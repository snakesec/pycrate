11	Message functional definitions and contents
This sub-clause defines the structure of the RLC/MAC control messages. These are non-standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. The formats for the messages are valid only for the PDCH. The format for RLC/MAC control messages for use on the CCCH are defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.
The RLC/MAC control messages defined in this sub-clause may be used also on DBPSCH and SBPSCH in Iu mode. A subset of these messages is used exclusively in Iu mode. Messages belonging to that subset are labelled as "Iu mode only" in this technical specification. 
A subset of the Iu mode only messages is used exclusively on DBPSCH. These messages do not follow the general syntactical rules for the RLC/MAC control messages used on shared channels. The error handling defined for shared channels does not apply. Messages that may be sent from the network to the mobile station, and that belong to this subset, are classified as DBPSCH messages, see sub-clause 11.1.1.
Specific RLC/MAC control messages, sent on the EC-PACCH, are used for EC TBFs.
Each definition given in the present sub-clause includes:
-	a brief description of the message direction and use;
-	a CSN.1 description of the message information elements and fields (see CSN.1 Specification, Version 2.0). Definition of information elements may immediately follow the definition of the message. If the definition of an information element immediately follows the message definition, the information element name ends with 'struct'. Otherwise the information element name ends with 'IE' and the definition of the information element is defined in clause 12 or in 3GPP TS 44.018. The definition of a 'struct' is valid only within the table in which it is defined. No references shall be made to a 'struct' definition from outside of the table in which it is defined or from outside the present document. The definition of an information element is valid throughout clause 11 and clause 12 as well as in 3GPP TS 44.018;
-	a note specifying, where appropriate, conditions for information elements or fields with presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with other conditions specified in 3GPP TS 44.060 define when the information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such information elements or fields means, and - for IEs with presence requirement C - the static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the information elements or fields (see 3GPP TS 24.007);
-	a table follows which contains a definition for each field referenced in the message definition or in an information element struct immediately following the message definition.
Bit fields within RLC/MAC messages shall have the highest numbered bit of the bit field in the highest numbered bit of the lowest number octet (see sub-clause 10.0b.3.1). The mapping of an 11 bit field is illustrated in figure 11.1.

Figure 11.1: Field mapping within RLC/MAC messages
The length of an RLC/MAC control messages is an integer number of RLC/MAC control blocks. Padding bits are necessary to fill the message up to the desired length. The padding bits may be the 'null' string. Otherwise, the padding bits starts with bit '0', followed by 'spare padding'.
< padding bits > ::= { null | 0 < spare padding > ! < Ignore : 1 bit** = < no string > > } ;

The padding sequence used for 'spare padding' in the present document, see 3GPP TS 24.007, is a repetition of octet '00101011', starting on an octet boundary.
11.1	Handling of erroneous protocol data
This sub-clause specifies procedures for the handling of unknown and erroneous protocol data by the receiving entity.
These error-handling procedures are mandatory for the mobile station.
A message is defined to be syntactically incorrect if it violates rules of clauses 11 and 12, or if it contains at least one value defined as "reserved" in clauses 11 and 12. However, if the rules of clause 11 and 12 define a specific interpretation for a "reserved" value, the specified interpretation takes precedence and the considered field remains syntactically correct.
Decoding a received message based on its CSN.1 description yields the complete acceptance or rejection of the message. Error handling allows a message to be partially accepted even when some parts are erroneous.
Error detection mechanisms are introduced to identify which parts of a message to be protected against which kinds of errors.
11.1.1	Message classification
The packet data channel (PDCH) is a shared resource, i.e. all mobile stations assigned resources on a PDCH may receive a message sent by the network. The message type is identified by the MESSAGE_TYPE field contained in each message. The message type is used for classification and determining the message syntax.
Messages sent from the network to the mobile station on PDCH (A/Gb mode and Iu mode) or DBPSCH (Iu mode) are classified as either distribution messages or non-distribution messages. 
Messages sent from the network to the mobile station exclusively on DBPSCH (Iu mode) are classified as DBPSCH messages.
11.1.1.1	Distribution messages
A distribution message is recognised by the most significant bit of the message type being set to bit '1'. The general format of a distribution message, except for distribution messages on the EC-PACCH, sent from the network to the mobile station is:
< Distribution message > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 1 bit (5) >
	< Distribution contents >
	< padding bits > ;

The general format of a distribution message sent on the EC-PACCH from the network to the mobile station is: 
< Distribution message on EC-PACCH > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 1 bit (4) >
	< Distribution contents >
	< padding bits > ;

Any mobile stations may receive a distribution message. Depending on the protocol state of the mobile station, a distribution message shall be analysed as specified in sub-clauses 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the present document.
The 'Distribution contents' of a distribution message contains Page Mode information and any specific distribution information according to the syntax defined for the message type. The ‘Distribution contents’ of a distribution message on the EC-PACCH contains Used DL Coverage Class information instead of the Page Mode information. The 'padding bits' of a distribution message can be reduced to the null string.
The general format of the 'Distribution contents', except for distribution messages sent on the EC-PACCH, is:
< Distribution contents > ::=
	< PAGE_MODE : bit (2) >
	< specific distribution information > ;

The encoding of the Page Mode information is defined in sub-clause 12.20.
The general format of the 'Distribution contents' for distribution messages sent on the EC-PACCH is:
< Distribution contents on EC-PACCH > ::=
	< USED_DL_COVERAGE_CLASS : bit (2) >
	< specific distribution information > ;

The encoding of the Used DL Coverage Class information is defined in sub-clause 12.71.
11.1.1.2	Non-distribution messages
A non-distribution message is recognised by the most significant bit of the message type being set to bit '0'. The general format of a message, except for non-distribution messages on the EC-PACCH, sent from the network to the mobile station is:
< Non-distribution message > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 0 bit (5) >
	< Distribution contents >
	< Address information > < Non-distribution contents >
	< padding bits > ;

The general format of a non-distribution message on the EC-PACCH sent from the network to the mobile station is:
< Non-distribution message on EC-PACCH > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 0 bit (4) >
	< Distribution contents >
	< Address information > < Non-distribution contents >
	< padding bits > ;

Any mobile station may receive a non-distribution message.
The 'Distribution contents' of a non-distribution message contains Page Mode information and any specific distribution information according to the syntax defined for the message type. The ‘Distribution contents’ of a non-distribution message on the EC-PACCH contains Used DL Coverage Class information instead of the Page Mode information. The general format of the 'Distribution contents' is defined in sub-clause 11.1.1.1. Depending on the protocol state of the mobile station, the 'Distribution contents' of a non‑distribution message shall be analysed as specified in clauses 5 and 7 of the present document.
The 'Address information' contained in a non-distribution message shall be analysed by a mobile station receiving the message. The 'Non-distribution contents' following the address information shall be ignored by any mobile station not identified by the address information. The allowed addressing options and the specific syntax of the 'Non-distribution contents' depend on the message type. The 'padding bits' of a non-distribution message can be reduced to the null string.
11.1.1.2.1	Format of the address information
The general format of the 'Address information' in a non-distribution message is:
< Address information > ::=
	0	< Global TFI IE > |	-- see sub-clause 12.10
	1 0	< TLLI / G-RNTI > |	-- see sub-clause 12.16
	1 1 0	< TQI > |	-- see sub-clause 12.17
	1 1 1	< Packet Request Reference IE > ;	-- see sub-clause 12.11

The description of a certain message type may specify a restricted set of addressing options being syntactically correct in the message. A message received with a disallowed addressing option shall be regarded as syntactically incorrect.
11.1.1.3	DBPSCH message (Iu mode only)
A DBPSCH message is sent exclusively on DBPSCH, from the network to the mobile station, in Iu mode. The general format of such a message is:
< DBPSCH message > ::=
	< DBPSCH message contents >
	< padding bits > ;

The 'padding bits' of a DBPSCH message can be reduced to the null string.
The general format of the 'DBPSCH message contents' is:
< DBPSCH message contents > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : bit (6) >
	< specific DBPSCH message information > ;

11.1.2	Error detection mechanism
The symbol '!' indicates an error branch. It acts as a separator (similar to the '|' choice symbol) where the choice on the right of the '!' are to be considered as an 'error' branch. The symbol '!' allows partial analysis of data in a received message, with some parts of the message to be ignored due to it being syntactically incorrect.
The description on the left of '!' defines the set of syntactically correct data and shall be recognised correctly. Otherwise, the data associated shall be rejected and the description within the error branch shall be used.
The description within the error branch, on the right of '!', shall accept any syntactically incorrect data. Therefore, according to the error label the relevant error handling procedure shall be implemented.
11.1.3	Error labels
There are different categories of error labels introduced in clauses 11 and 12 of the present document.
11.1.3.1	Generic error labels
Generic error labels are defined for syntactical errors 'Unknown message type', 'Distribution part error', 'Address information part error' and 'Non-distribution part error'.
The general format of a distribution message (except for a distribution message on the EC-PACCH), including these error labels, is:
--< Distribution message > ::=
--	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 1 bit (5) >
--	{	< Distribution contents >
--		< padding bits >
--		! < Distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--	! < Unknown message type : bit (6) = < no string > < Default downlink message content > > ;

The general format of a distribution message on the EC-PACCH, including these error labels, is:
--< Distribution message on EC-PACCH > ::=
--	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 1 bit (4) >
--	{	< Distribution contents >
--		< padding bits >
--		! < Distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--	! < Unknown message type : bit (5) = < no string > < Default downlink message content > > ;

The general format of a non-distribution message (except for a non-distribution message on the EC-PACCH), including these error labels, is:
--< Non-distribution message > ::=
--	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 0 bit (5) >
--	{	< Distribution contents >
--		{	< Address information >
--			{	< Non-distribution contents >
--				< padding bits >
--				! < Non-distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--			! < Address information part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--		! < Distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--	! < Unknown message type : bit (6) = < no string > < Default downlink message content > > ;

The general format of a non-distribution message on the EC-PACCH, including these error labels, is:
--< Non-distribution message on EC-PACCH > ::=
--	< MESSAGE_TYPE : 0 bit (4) >
--	{	< Distribution contents >
--		{	< Address information >
--			{	< Non-distribution contents >
--				< padding bits >
--				! < Non-distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--			! < Address information part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--		! < Distribution part error : bit (*) = < no string > > }
--	! < Unknown message type : bit (5) = < no string > < Default downlink message content > > ;

The general format of a DBPSCH message, including these error labels, is:
--< DBPSCH message > ::=
--	{	< DBPSCH message contents >
--		< padding bits >
--		! < DBPSCH message part error : bit (*) = < no string > > } ;

These error labels allow ignoring a part of the message that is syntactically incorrect. Once an error is detected, the error branch is called. Except for the 'Unknown message type', the error branch is, followed by an unspecified bit string that expands to the end of the message. The corresponding data is ignored. In case of an 'Unknown message type', further treatment of the message is defined in sub-clause 11.1.4.1.
11.1.3.2	'Ignore' error label
An 'Ignore' error label is used to ignore part of the message. The generic description is:
	< content > ! < Ignore : bit (*) = < no string > >	-- Ignore by indefinite length

Or

	< content of fixed length n > ! < Ignore : bit (n) = < no string > >	-- Ignore by definite length

An 'Ignore' error label shall be applied by the receiver of a downlink RLC/MAC control message when specified in the message description in clauses 11 and 12 of the present document. This error label allows ignoring a part of the message that is syntactically incorrect. Once the error is detected, the error branch 'Ignore' is called followed by an unspecified bit string.
When this error label is used with an indefinite length (bit (*) = < no string >), the unspecified bit string expands to the end of the message and the corresponding data is ignored.
NOTE:	If this error label is used with the indefinite length within a structure or delimited description (i.e. within { } brackets), any description following the structure or delimited description must allow truncation, in order to be consistent with the CSN.1 description of the message.
When this error label is used with a definite length (bit (n) = < no string >), the unspecified bit string contains a defined number of bits. The corresponding data is ignored.
11.1.3.3	'Message escape' error label
The 'Message escape' error label is used to provide an escape for, e.g. a future modification of the message syntax. The generic description is:
	0 < Content > ! < Message escape : 1 bit (*) = < no string > >

An 'Message escape' error label shall be applied by the receiver of a downlink RLC/MAC control message when specified in the message description in clauses 11 and 12 of the present document. The description on the left of the error branch needs to be correctly recognised. Otherwise, the error branch 'Message escape' is called and the remaining part of the message is ignored.
NOTE:	Any description following a structure or delimited description (i.e. within { } brackets) including this error label must allow truncation. Otherwise, it is not consistent with the CSN.1 description of the message.
11.1.4	Error detection and order of precedence
A mobile station shall detect and process errors in the order in which they are defined in this sub-clause of the present document. (E.g. a message, which is not compatible with the current protocol state AND is syntactically incorrect, shall be treated as if it is not compatible with the current protocol state.)
At certain error events defined in this sub-clause, the PACKET TBF STATUS message shall be sent by the mobile station. In case of multiple error events, and, due to restrictions defined in sub-clauses 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, the mobile station is not able to send a first status message until the occurrence of a subsequent event generating a second status message, the mobile station shall suppress the sending of the second and additional status messages until the first status message has been sent to the network.
11.1.4.1	Unknown message type
If a mobile station receives a message with message type either not defined or not implemented (generic error label: 'Unknown message type'), the content of the bits representing the message type shall be ignored.
The remaining part of the message shall be analysed according to the syntax defined as the 'Default downlink message content' in sub-clause 11.2.0.1. The 'Default downlink message content' contains the Page Mode information. Depending on the protocol state of the mobile station, the Page Mode information shall be analysed as specified in clause 5 of the present document. The 'Default downlink message content' for a downlink message sent on the EC-PACCH contains the Used DL Coverage Class information instead of the Page Mode information.
11.1.4.2	Message not compatible with current protocol state
When a non-distribution message is received, which is not expected by the addressed receiver in its current protocol state, the mobile station shall follow the procedures that are described in sub-clauses 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 of the present document.
If no such reaction is specified, the mobile station shall ignore the message. If in packet transfer mode, the mobile station, which is identified by the address information, shall return a status message (PACKET MOBILE TBF STATUS message) with TBF_CAUSE #4, "Message not compatible with current protocol state", unless the mobile station has an ongoing EC TBF.
Unexpected distribution messages are ignored.
11.1.4.3	Syntactically incorrect message
When a message containing a syntactically incorrect data is received, depending on the error detection mechanisms that may be defined in the CSN.1 description of the message, the message can be rejected or partially accepted.
NOTE:	The order, in which the error labels mentioned in this sub-clause are detected and processed, depends on the nesting of error labels defined by the description of each message type in sub-clause 11.2 and clause 12. E.g. a message, which contains syntactically incorrect data in both the addressing information AND the non-distribution contents, is typically received with the error label 'Address information part error'.
11.1.4.3.1	Messages with error label: 'Distribution part error'
For syntactically incorrect messages received with generic error label: 'Distribution part error', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as erroneous data and be ignored.
11.1.4.3.2	Messages with error label: 'Address information part error'
For syntactically incorrect messages received with generic error label: 'Address information part error', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as erroneous data and be ignored. The distribution contents preceding the error label may be analysed and treated as described in clause 5 and clause 7 of the present document.
11.1.4.3.3	Messages with error label: 'Non-distribution part error'
For syntactically incorrect messages received with generic error label: 'Non-distribution part error', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as erroneous data and be ignored.
The distribution contents preceding the error label may be analysed and treated as described in clause 5 and clause 7 of the present document.
The address information preceding the error label shall be analysed. In packet transfer mode, the mobile station identified by the address information shall return a PACKET MOBILE TBF STATUS message with TBF_CAUSE #2 "Syntactically incorrect message, non-distribution part error", unless the mobile station has an ongoing EC TBF.
11.1.4.3.4	Messages with error label: 'Message escape'
For syntactically incorrect messages with error label: 'Message escape', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as erroneously received mandatory data and be rejected.
The distribution contents preceding the error label may be analysed and treated as described in clause 5 of the present document.
If the address information proceeds the error label and it is received correctly, it shall be analysed. In packet transfer mode, the mobile station identified by the address information shall return a PACKET MOBILE TBF STATUS message with TBF_CAUSE #3 "Syntactically incorrect message, message escape", unless the mobile station has an ongoing EC TBF.
11.1.4.3.5	Messages with error label: 'Ignore'
For syntactically incorrect messages with error label: 'Ignore', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as unnecessary data. If a syntactically incorrect message with the 'Ignore' error label is received, depending on the length of the unspecified bit string associated with the error label (sub-clause 11.1.3.2), the corresponding data shall be ignored.
11.1.4.3.6	Messages with error label: "DBPSCH message part error"
For syntactically incorrect messages received with generic error label: 'DBPSCH message part error', data corresponding to the description following the error label shall be recognised as erroneous data and be ignored.
11.1.4.4	Syntactic error in truncated concatenation
Truncated concatenation is sequences of components encapsulated by the { } brackets followed by the symbol '//'. The concatenation is any of the concatenations starting with null and up to any number of components.
	{ < a > < b > < c > } //

The above set is equivalent to:
	{ < a > < b > < c > }	or
	{ < a > < b > }	or
	{ < a > }	or
	null

Any syntactically incorrect component shall truncate the sequence. The correctly received components are accepted and the truncated components are ignored.
NOTE:	If the 'padding bits' at the end of a message are included within the concatenation, truncation requires the resulting concatenation to fit exactly with the received message length. Otherwise, it is a syntactical error, which may cause rejection of the complete message or part thereof.
11.1.4.5	(void)
11.2	RLC/MAC control messages
Table 11.2.1 summarises the RLC/MAC control messages. Table 11.2.2 summarises the RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH. For each control message, the message type shall be a fixed number of bits from the beginning of the message.

11.2.0	Message format
All RLC/MAC control messages, with the exception of the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message in access burst format (11-bit and 8-bit contents), the HANDOVER ACCESS message in access burst format (8-bit content), the PS HANDOVER ACCESS message, the PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message, MPRACH PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message and the RLC/MAC control messages sent on the EC-PACCH follow the same non-standard format (see 3GPP TS 24.007).
The RLC/MAC control messages sent on the EC-PACCH follow the same non-standard format (see 3GPP TS 24.007).
11.2.0.1	Downlink RLC/MAC messages
Downlink RLC/MAC control messages are received in RLC/MAC control block format. The different types of messages are distinguished by the MESSAGE_TYPE field.
< Downlink RLC/MAC control message > ::=
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : bit (6) == 1 00001 >	< Packet Access Reject message content > |
	< MESSAGE_TYPE : bit (6) == 0 00001 >	< Packet Cell Change Order message content > |

Reject struct
The mobile station shall only accept the first Reject struct addressed to it and ignore all other Reject structs.
Iu mode Reject struct
For each occurrence of a G-RNTI in the TLLI / G-RNTI field of a Reject struct, a corresponding Iu mode Reject struct shall be included in the message. The list of Iu mode Reject structs shall address the Iu mode mobile stations in the same order as the list of G-RNTI values in the Reject structs. 
A/Gb mode Reject struct
For each occurrence of a TLLI in the TLLI / G-RNTI field of a Reject struct, a corresponding A/Gb mode Reject struct shall be included in the message. The list of A/Gb mode Reject structs shall address the A/Gb mode mobile stations in the same order as the list of TLLI values in the Reject structs. 
Packet Request Reference
This information element shall be included if the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message is sent in response to a PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message. This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.11.
TLLI / G-RNTI (32 bit field)
This information field shall be included if the PACKET ACCESS REJECT message is sent in response to a PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message or a Channel Request Description IE contained in a PACKET DOWNLINK ACK/NACK message. This information field is defined in sub-clause 12.16.
G-RNTI extension (4 bit field)
This field contains the extra 4 bits of the G-RNTI not included in the TLLI / G-RNTI field which are necessary to provide a unique identifier for contention resolution in Iu-mode.
For each occurrence of the TLLI / G-RNTI field in the Reject struct, the corresponding G-RNTI extension field shall be included in the Iu mode reject struct in the same order as the list of G-RNTI values in the TLLI / G-RNTI field. 
Global TFI
This information element contains the TFI of one of the mobile station's downlink TBFs or uplink TBFs. This field is defined in sub-clause 12.10.
WAIT_INDICATION (8 bit field)
The Wait Indication field indicates the time the mobile station shall wait before attempting another channel request. This field is coded as the binary representation of the T3172 timeout value in units of 20 ms or in units of seconds. The units are indicated in the WAIT_INDICATION_SIZE field.
Range 0 to 255.
WAIT_INDICATION_SIZE (1 bit field)
This field indicates the units of the WAIT_INDICATION field.
0	the WAIT_INDICATION field is coded in units of s
1	the WAIT_INDICATION field is coded in units of 20 ms
RB Id (5 bit field)
This field contains the identifier of the radio bearer for which a TBF was requested. 
PFI (7 bit field)
This field contains the PFI parameter identifying a Packet Flow Context. The PFI parameter is encoded as the contents of the PFI information element defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.

11.2.2	Packet Control Acknowledgement
This message is sent on the PACCH from the mobile station to the network. In Iu mode, it is also sent on FACCH, SACCH and SDCCH from the mobile station to the network. The message is formatted either as an RLC/MAC control block using the PACCH block format defined in 3GPP TS 44.004 or as 4 identical access bursts using the PACCH short acknowledgement block format defined in 3GPP TS 44.004. If the CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field is to be included (i.e. the MS is sending acknowledgement information for a RLC/MAC control message which it knows to have been segmented using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation - see Table 11.2.2.2) the message shall be formatted as an RLC/MAC control block. Otherwise, if sent as response to a Packet Polling Request message this latter message shall specify the format of the Packet Control Acknowledgement message. Otherwise the System Information parameter CONTROL_ACK_TYPE indicates which format the mobile station shall use. The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004. The numbering, assembling and field mapping conventions defined for RLC/MAC control blocks in sub-clause 10.0b shall apply.
The RLC/MAC control block format is shown in table 11.2.2.1 and table 11.2.2.2.
The access burst format is either 11-bit or 8-bit and is coded as shown in table 11.2.2.1. The mobile station shall use the format indicated by the System Information parameter ACCESS_BURST_TYPE. The mobile station shall transmit the access burst four times, one time in each TDMA frame of the uplink radio block.

Table 11.2.2.2: PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
TLLI/G-RNTI (32 bit field)
This field contains the TLLI/G-RNTI of the mobile station. This field is encoded as defined in sub-clause 12.16.
CTRL_ACK (2 bit field)
This field contains acknowledgement information for the group of RLC/MAC control blocks that make up an RLC/MAC control message. The mobile station shall set the CTRL_ACK field to indicate which segments of an RLC/MAC control message have been received by the time of transmission of the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message.
This field can also be coded to contain the information if the mobile station is requesting the establishment of new TBF. This coding is allowed only when the message is sent in access burst format as a response to the PACKET UPLINK ACK/NACK message with Final Ack Indicator set to '1' and TBF Est is set to '1'.
If the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is being transmitted in response to a valid RRBP field received as part of an RLC/MAC block with Payload Type equal to '10', the CTRL_ACK field shall be set according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0		in case the message is sent in access burst format, the same meaning as for the value '11' except that the mobile station is requesting new TBF. Otherwise the bit value '00' is reserved and shall not be sent. If received it shall be intepreted as bit value '01'.
0 1		the MS received an RLC/MAC control block addressed to itself and with RBSN = 1, and did not receive an	RLC/MAC control block with the same RTI value and RBSN = 0.
1 0		the MS received an RLC/MAC control block addressed to itself and with RBSN = 0, and did not receive an	RLC/MAC control block with the same RTI value and RBSN = 1. This value is sent irrespective of the value of the FS bit.
1 1		the MS received two RLC/MAC blocks with the same RTI value, one with RBSN = 0 and the other with RBSN = 1.

If the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is being transmitted in response to a valid RRBP field received as part of an RLC/MAC block with Payload Type not equal to '10', the CTRL_ACK field shall be set to the value '11' in case the message is sent in normal burst format or in case the mobile station is not requesting new TBF. In case the message is sent in access burst format and the mobile station is requesting new TBF, the CTRL_ACK field shall be set to the value '00'.
If the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is being transmitted in response to a polling request in an IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT message received on CCCH, the CTRL_ACK field shall be set to the value '11'.
If the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block with Payload Type equal to '10' and RLC/MAC block with Payload Type not equal to '10' with different RRBP values such that they specify the same uplink block, the mobile station shall set the CTRL_ACK field according to the group of RLC/MAC control blocks that the RLC/MAC block with Payload Type equal to '10' belongs.
CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION (9 bit field)
This field contains acknowledgement information for the group of up to nine RLC/MAC control blocks that make up an RLC/MAC control message sent using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation. The mobile station shall set the CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field to indicate which segments of an RLC/MAC control message addressed to itself have been received by the time of transmission of the PACKET CONTROL ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message. Bit at index n in the CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field indicates whether RLC/MAC control block "10 - n" has been received. This bit shall be set to ‘1’ if the corresponding RLC/MAC control block has been received and to ‘0’ otherwise. When CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field is present, the CTRL_ACK field shall be ignored. The CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field shall be included only if the MS knows an RLC/MAC control message has been segmented using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation (i.e. the MS has received at least one segment other than the first segment of an RLC/MAC control message segmented using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation). The CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field shall not be included if the MS has only received the first segment of an RLC/MAC control message and hence does not know whether extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation is used.
bit
9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0		this value is reserved and shall not be sent.
1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0		this value is reserved and shall not be sent.
 …
0 0 1 0 1 0 0 0 0	the MS received the 3rd and 5th segments (i.e. with RBSN = ‘1’ and RBSNe = ‘001’ and RBSN = ‘1’ and RBSNe = ‘011’ respectively) of an RLC/MAC control message sent using a given RTI value and did not receive any other RLC/MAC control block(s) with other RBSN and RBSNe values having that same RTI value.
 …
1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1		the MS received all nine segments of an RLC/MAC control message.

If the mobile station receives an RLC/MAC block with Payload Type equal to '10' and an RLC/MAC block with Payload Type not equal to '10' with different RRBP values such that they specify the same uplink block, the mobile station shall set the CTRL_ACK_EXTENSION field according to the group of RLC/MAC control blocks that the RLC/MAC block with Payload Type equal to '10' belongs.
TN_RRBP (3 bit field)
This field contains the timeslot number of the downlink PDCH on which the RRBP was received. The TN_RRBP field is coded as the binary representation of the timeslot number as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.
G-RNTI extension (4 bit field)
This field contains the extra 4 bits of the G-RNTI not included in the TLLI / G-RNTI field which are necessary to provide a unique identifier in Iu mode.

0 0	Dynamic Allocation
0 1	Extended Dynamic Allocation
1 0	Reserved	-- The value '10' was allocated in an earlier version of the protocol and shall not be used.
1 1	Reserved	-- The value '11' was allocated in an earlier version of the protocol and shall not be used.
RLC_MODE (1 bit field)
This field indicates the RLC mode of the requested TBF. If EMST is used, this field indicates the RLC mode of the RLC entity..
0	RLC acknowledged mode
1	RLC unacknowledged mode. For the case of an EGPRS TBF an MS that supports RLC non-persistent mode shall respond to this indication of RLC mode as described in the EGPRS Window Size IE (see sub-clause 12.5.2).

CONTROL_ACK (1 bit field)
In A/Gb mode, this field shall be set to '1' if the network establishes a new downlink TBF for the mobile station whose timer T3192 is running. Otherwise this field shall be set to '0'.
In Iu mode, this field shall be set to '1' if the network wishes to instruct the mobile station to release a given TBF for which timer T3192 is running. The TBF to be released is identified by the TFI given in the DOWNLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT field and has to be valid on the PACCH on which this message was sent. Otherwise this field shall be set to '0'.
TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION (8 bit field)
This field is defined in sub-clause 12.18.
TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C1, TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C2 (8 bit field)
These information fields indicate the timeslots assigned for use during the TBF. If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C1 shall apply to the carrier indicated by the Carrier ID field.  Otherwise, TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C1 and TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C2 shall apply on carrier 1 and carrier 2 respectively of a dual carrier configuration. These fields are defined in sub-clause 12.18. 
If TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C1 is present and TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C2 is not present and the Assignment Type field indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment', then the timeslots specified in TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION_C1 apply also to carrier 2.
For the case of a downlink carrier assigned for a DLMC configuration the assignment message shall provide the TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION IE for at least the first carrier in the corresponding UFPS. If this IE is absent for any remaining carriers, the TIMESLOT_ALLOCATION IE for the lowest numbered carrier (see sub-clause 8.1.1.1.3) shall apply.
Packet Timing Advance
This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.12.
P0, P0_C1, P0_C2 (4 bit field)
For description and encoding, see the Packet Uplink Assignment message. If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then P0_C1 shall apply to the carrier indicated by the Carrier ID field. Otherwise, P0_C1and P0_C2 shall apply to carrier 1 and carrier 2 respectively. If the P0_C1 IE is present but the P0_C2 IE is absent and the Assignment Type field indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment', then the P0_C1 IE shall apply also to carrier 2.
For the case of a downlink carrier assigned for a DLMC configuration the assignment message shall provide the P0 IE for at least the first carrier in the corresponding UFPS. If this IE is absent for any remaining carriers, the P0 IE for the lowest numbered carrier (see sub-clause 8.1.1.1.3) shall apply.
PR_MODE, PR_MODE_C1, PR_MODE_C2 (1 bit field)
For description and encoding, see the Packet Uplink Assignment message. If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then PR_MODE_C1 shall apply to the carrier specified in the Carrier ID field. Otherwise, PR_MODE_C1 and PR_MODE_C2 shall apply to carrier 1 and carrier 2 respectively. If the Assignment Type field indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment' and the PR_MODE_C1 IE is present but the PR_MODE_C2 IE is absent, then the PR_MODE_C1 IE shall apply also to carrier 2.
For the case of a downlink carrier assigned for a DLMC configuration the assignment message shall provide the PR_MODE IE for at least the first carrier in the corresponding UFPS. If this IE is absent for any remaining carriers, the PR_MODE IE for the lowest numbered carrier (see sub-clause 8.1.1.1.3) shall apply.

This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.8.2.
DOWNLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT (5 bit field)
This information element, if present, assigns the TFI to the mobile station to identify the downlink TBF described by this message. TFI is encoded as defined in sub-clause 12.15. If EMST is used, each TFI identifies an RLC entity allocated on the downlink TBF. If EMSR is supported, each TFI identifies a Packet Flow Context supported by a specific RLC entity allocated on the downlink TBF.
If a DLMC configuration is established, the assignment message shall provide the DOWNLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT IE for at least the first carrier in the corresponding UFPS. If this IE is absent for any remaining carriers, the DOWNLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT IE for the first carrier in the first UFPS shall apply.
TBF Starting Time
The TBF Starting Time field contains a starting time that indicates the TDMA frame number during which the assigned TBF may start. If no downlink TBF is in progress, the mobile station need not monitor the TFI field of downlink RLC data blocks until the indicated TDMA frame number. After the indicated TDMA frame number, the mobile station shall operate as during a downlink TBF. If a downlink TBF is already in progress, the mobile station shall continue to use the parameters of the existing TBF until the TDMA frame number occurs. When the indicated TDMA frame number occurs, the mobile station shall immediately begin to use the new parameters assigned. This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.21.
EGPRS Window Size
This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.5.2.
LINK_QUALITY_MEASUREMENT_MODE (2 bit field)
This field determines the measurements to be included within the EGPRS Timeslot Link Quality Measurements IE or EGPRS Timeslot Link Quality Measurements Type 2 IE. In case the assignment results in a dual carrier configuration, the value of the LINK_QUALITY_MEASUREMENT_MODE field shall apply to both carriers. In case the assignment results in a DLMC configuration, the value of the LINK_QUALITY_MEASUREMENT_MODE field shall apply to all carriers.

bit
2 1
0 0	The mobile station shall not report either interference measurements ( values) or per slot (slot pair in RTTI configuration) mean BEP measurements.

0 1	The mobile station shall report available interference measurements ( values) for timeslots 0 through 7. The  value is defined in 3GPP TS 45.008. No per slot (slot pair in RTTI configuration) mean BEP measurements shall be reported.

For a mobile station in a DLMC configuration, available interference measurements shall be reported for timeslots 0 through 7 for the carrier indicated by the assignment message or the lowest numbered downlink carrier if carrier information for interference measurements is not provided by the assignment message (see sub-clause 12.66 for additional reporting rules).

1 0	The mobile station shall report the mean BEP on each assigned time slot (slot pair in RTTI configuration) as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. No interference measurements ( values) shall be reported. For a mobile station in a DLMC configuration where measurement information is to be reported on a per carrier basis (see sub-clause 11.2.7), the mean BEP (as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008) shall only be reported for the assigned timeslots on the carrier on which it was polled (see sub-clause 12.66). A mobile station in a DLMC configuration where measurement information is to be reported on a per UFPS basis (see sub-clause 9.1.8.2.1) shall treat this code point as the ‘00’ code point. 

1 1	The mobile station shall report the mean BEP on each assigned time slot (slot pair in RTTI configuration) as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. In addition to mean BEP, the mobile station shall report interference measurements ( values) for no more than four time slots for a given carrier within a single reporting message instance. If the MS has interference measurements for more than four timeslots to report for a given carrier, the selection of timeslots for which interference measurements are included in each message instance is implementation specific, subject to the requirement that a measurement for each time slot on each carrier, unless not available (see 3GPP TS 45.008), is included in at least every other report. 

For a mobile station in a DLMC configuration, available interference measurements shall be reported for timeslots 0 through 7 for the carrier indicated by the assignment message or the lowest numbered downlink carrier if carrier information for interference measurements is not provided by the assignment message (see sub-clause 12.66 for additional reporting rules). If measurement information is to be reported on a per carrier basis (see sub-clause 11.2.7), the mean BEP (as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008) shall only be reported for the assigned timeslots on the carrier on which it was polled (see sub-clause 12.66). A mobile station in a DLMC configuration where measurement information is to be reported on a per UFPS basis (see sub-clause 9.1.8.2.1) shall treat this code point as the ‘01’ code point.

	In addition, for a mobile station assigned a Downlink Dual Carrier configuration, if not all the required interference measurements can be included within a reporting message instance after all the required per slot mean BEP values for both carriers have been included, the mobile station shall include as many interference measurements (if any) as can fit in this message instance. The selection of timeslots for which interference measurements are included in each message instance is implementation specific. See sub-clause 9.1.8.2.1 for how a mobile station in a DLMC configuration can report information for more than one UFPS/carrier.

If the Assignment Type indicates an Assignment on a single carrier only the resources specified in this message are assigned for this TBF on the carrier identified by the Carrier ID field. If the assignment is sent to a mobile station that does not currently have a dual carrier configuration, the Carrier ID field shall indicate Carrier 1 and all resources specified in the message shall relate to Carrier 1.
If the Assignment Type indicates Modification of an existing assignment resources specified in this message replace any existing allocation for this TBF on the carrier indicated by the Carrier ID field. If this type of assignment is used to place a mobile station which currently has resources assigned on only one carrier in a dual carrier configuration the Carrier ID shall indicate Carrier 2.
If the Assignment Type indicates a Dual Carrier assignment the Carrier ID field shall be ignored by the mobile station.
The meaning of the different types of assignment is specified in sub-clause 8.1.1.1.3.

MTTI_DOWNLINK_ASSIGNMENT_C1 (1 bit field)
MTTI_DOWNLINK_ASSIGNMENT_C2 (1 bit field)
If either of these fields is present, it indicates that the assigned downlink TBF operates in an MTTI configuration. If present, a PDCH is assigned on the respective carrier in addition to any assigned PDCH-pairs. If set to '1' (respectively '0'), the assigned PDCH uses the timeslot immediately adjacent to and lower than (respectively higher than) the lower (respectively higher) timeslot used by the lowest numbered (respectively highest numbered) PDCH-pair assigned on that carrier. If no PDCH-pairs are assigned on one carrier, then the assigned PDCH for that carrier is on the same timeslot as the assigned PDCH on the other carrier, regardless of the value of the field.
EMSR Additional PFCs 1
EMSR Additional PFCs 2
EMSR Additional PFCs 3
If EMSR is supported one or more of these information elements may be included for allocating multiple PFCs to their corresponding RLC entity:
-	if EMST is not used, EMSR Additional PFCs 1 corresponds to the single RLC entity of the TBF; EMSR Additional PFCs 2 and EMSR Additional PFCs 3, if present, shall be ignored.
-	if EMST is used, EMSR Additional PFCs 1, EMSR Additional PFCs 2 and EMSR Additional PFCs 3 correspond to the first, the second and the third RLC entity, respectively, assigned to the TBF.

UFPS
This information element is used to identify the set of resources corresponding to each UFPS within the set of UFPS assigned for a DLMC configuration. Each UFPS in the set of UFPS is numbered according to the scheme described in sub-clause 8.1.1.1.3. The assignment message allows for releasing an existing UFPS, keeping an existing UFPS unchanged, modifying an existing UFPS or adding a new UFPS. 

For the case where a UFPS is defined by a MA the first frequency indicated for the UFPS (i.e. by the CARRIER_SPECIFIC_INFO IE) is that corresponding to highest numbered element of the MA_BITMAP for which a ‘1’ is indicated, the second frequency indicated is that corresponding to 2nd highest numbered element of the MA_BITMAP for which a ‘1’ is indicated, and so on where the last frequency indicated is that corresponding to lowest numbered element of the MA_BITMAP for which a ‘1’ is indicated.  See sub-clause 12.10a for a description of the MA_BITMAP field.

It is coded as the binary representation of the Training Sequence code as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002. Range: 0 to 7.

11.2.7.1	Special requirements in dual transfer mode for downlink TBF
Special requirements apply when a downlink TBF is assigned to a mobile station in dual transfer mode or a mobile station about to enter dual transfer mode.
If the mobile station has an RR connection to the network on a half-rate TCH, the network may assign a downlink TBF using the other sub-channel of the same timeslot for a half-rate PDCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002). In this case, the downlink assignment message shall be encoded with a timeslot allocation including the timeslot number for the half-rate TCH and the half-rate PDCH and only that timeslot number. The mobile station shall interpret this allocation as an allocation of a half-rate PDCH.
11.2.7a	Multiple TBF Downlink Assignment
This message is sent on the PACCH by the network to the mobile station to assign multiple downlink resources to the mobile station. If the mobile station supports Downlink Dual Carrier, this message may be sent using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation (see sub-clause 9.1.12a).
A mobile allocation or reference frequency list received as part of this assignment message shall be valid until a new assignment is received or until all of the TBFs belonging to the MS are terminated.

Table 11.2.9b.2 : Packet Measurement Order information element details
The Packet Measurement Order message contains measurement parameters either for Network Control measurements If parameters for the NC measurements are not included, a previous Packet Measurement Order message belonging to the same set of messages shall still be valid.
The 'NC measurement parameters struct' contains the Network Control Order, the NC parameters and an NC Frequency List struct. If the value of the Network Control Order or any of the NC parameters differs between instances of the message, the value of the parameter in the instance with the highest PMO_INDEX shall be valid and all others shall be ignored. 
If included the NC Frequency List struct is a deviation list which contains removed or added frequencies to the BA(GPRS) list (see 3GPP TS 45.008). The building of the resulting GSM Neighbour Cell list is defined in sub-clause 5.6.3.2.
The 'LSA parameters IE' contains a list of LSA_ID(s) corresponding to the entries in the 'Add Frequency list struct'. Some entries in 'LSA parameters IE' may be empty. The entries in the two structures are listed in the same order and the number of entries (nr_of_frequencies) should be the same. In case there are too few entries in the 'LSA parameters IE', empty entries shall be added at the end. In case there are too many entries in the 'LSA parameters IE', the last shall be discarded. The 'LSA parameters IE' is defined in sub-clause 12.28.
The 'ENH Measurement parameters structure' contains information for performing enhanced measurements and reporting the measurement with the PACKET MEASUREMENT REPORT or PACKET ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message. For a 3G multi-RAT mobile station it may also include information for reporting on 3G Cells.

This construction is a representation of the cell allocation (CA) defined for the cell. The set of radio frequency channels contained in the referenced RFLs in this construction defines the cell allocation.
GPRS Mobile Allocations (construction)
This construction is the representation of the GPRS mobile allocations provided in an instance of the PSI2 message. An MA_NUMBER field preceding each GPRS mobile allocation identifies the GPRS mobile allocation. The receiver shall disregard a GPRS mobile allocation provided in this message that is identified by MA_NUMBER = 14 or 15.
PCCCH Description (construction)
This construction is a representation of the timeslots carrying PCCCH in the cell and their frequency configurations. The training sequence code (TSC) preceding each list of PCCCH carriers in the PCCCH description shall be used for the timeslots selected for PCCCH on those PCCCH carriers. The TSC that is used for the timeslot also carrying PBCCH shall equal the TSC used for the PBCCH in the cell.
The number of timeslots carrying PCCCH in the cell is denoted KC. This is also the implicit value of the parameter BS_PCC_CHANS, see 3GPP TS 45.002. The range for KC is 1 to 16 if PBCCH (and PCCCH) is present in the cell. (KC = 0 if PBCCH is not present in the cell.)
The mapping of the PCCCH_GROUPs (numbered from 0 to KC-1) starts with the lowest numbered PCCCH_GROUP, which is mapped on the lowest numbered timeslot carrying PCCCH on the first (non-hopping or hopping) PCCCH carrier appearing in this construction. The next higher numbered PCCCH_GROUP is mapped on the next (if any) higher numbered timeslot carrying PCCCH on the same carrier, and so on. When all timeslots carrying PCCCH on the first carrier have been used, the next higher numbered PCCCH_GROUP is mapped on the lowest numbered timeslot carrying PCCCH on the next PCCCH carrier appearing in this construction, and so on. The highest numbered PCCCH_GROUP is mapped on the highest numbered timeslot carrying PCCCH on the last PCCCH carrier appearing in this construction.

The Neighbour cell parameters areused to specify neighbour cells (BA(GPRS)) and their corresponding cell selection parameters. The Neighbour cell parameters are specified in PSI3 and in at least one instance of PSI3bis. If one instance of PSI3bis is not sufficient to specify the cell selection parameters of all neighbour cells, the remaining neighbour cells are specified in consecutive instances of PSI3bis. If all information fits within the PSI3 message, one instance of PSI3bis without any neighbour cell parameters is broadcast.

General rules for handling neighbour cell parameter default values
The first neighbour cell defined in PSI3 uses as its default parameter values the parameter values defined for the serving cell. If a parameter is omitted for the serving cell then the specified default value shall be used. The following neighbour cells use the parameter values of the previous neighbour cell as their default values.
Cell Selection params
The first field of the Cell Selection struct, BSIC, defines the BSIC of the cell and then comes the fields CELL_BAR_ACCESS_2, ECX_ACC and SAME_RA_AS_SERVING_CELL.

The SI13_LOCATION field, if present, indicates the logical channel where the SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 is broadcast (see 3GPP TS 45.002).
0	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 message is sent on BCCH norm 
1	SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 13 message is sent on BCCH ext
PBCCH_LOCATION (2 bit field)
The PBCCH_LOCATION field, if present, indicates the location of the PBCCH on the BCCH carrier (see 3GPP TS 45.002). If the PBCCH location for a neighbour cell is given using this field, the TSC shall equal the BCC determined by the BSIC of that cell.

0 0	PBCCH on TN 1 of BCCH carrier
0 1	PBCCH on TN 2 of BCCH carrier
1 0	PBCCH on TN 3 of BCCH carrier
1 1	PBCCH on TN 4 of BCCH carrier
PSI1_REPEAT_PERIOD (4 bit field)
The PSI1_REPEAT_PERIOD field indicates the PSI repeat period. The field is coded according to the following table:
bit
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0	PSI1 repeat period = 1 
0 0 0 1	PSI1 repeat period = 2
...
1 1 1 1	PSI1 repeat period = 16
LSA Parameters IE
The LSA Parameters IE contains a list of LSA_ID(s) corresponding to the entries in the Neighbour Cell Parameters. Some entries in LSA parameters may be empty. The entries in the LSA Parameters IE are listed in the same order as in the Neighbour Cell Parameters and the number of entries (nr_of_frequencies_or_cells) should be the same. In case there are too few entries in the LSA Parameters IE, empty entries shall be added at the end. In case there are too many entries in the LSA parameters, the last shall be discarded. The 'LSA parameters IE' is defined in sub-clause 12.28.
LSA_ID (24 bit field)
The purpose of the LSA_ID field is to identify a LSA. The LSA ID value field is coded as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003.
Short LSA_ID (10 bit field)
The purpose of the Short LSA_ID field is to identify a LSA. The LSA ID defined by the Short LSA_ID is a LSA_ID as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 with bit 0 set to "0" bit 1 to 10 set to the value of the Short LSA_ID field (LSB in bit 1, MSB in bit 10) and bit 11 to 23 set to "0".
TIME_GROUP (2 bit field)
The TIME_GROUP defines which time group (see 3GPP TS 45.002) the cell belongs to
bit
2 1
0 0	Time Group 0
0 1	Time Group 1
1 0	Time Group 2
1 1	Time Group 3
GUAR_CONSTANT_PWR_BLKS (2 bit field)
This field indicates the guaranteed number of constant power blocks in the neighbour cell. These are the blocks that the MS can use to perform neighbour cell measurements (see 3GPP TS 45.008). Note that there may be more CPBCCH blocks or allowed paging blocks in the neighbour cell than what is indicated in this field, but never less.
bit
2 1	Blocks at constant power 
0 0	4
0 1	5
1 0	6
1 1	12 (i.e. BS_PAG_BLKS_RES = 0 in that cell)
Cell Identification
This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.23.
CCN Support Description 

CCN_SUPPORTED (1 bit field) 
This parameter is used for determining whether the mobile station shall enter CCN mode when re-selecting a cell and CCN is enabled. The use of these bits is described in sub-clause 8.8.2a ("CCN support description"):
Bit
0	CCN is enabled towards the corresponding cell
1	CCN is disabled towards the corresponding cell
CELL BAR QUALIFY 3 (2 bit field)
This information element is defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.
Iu mode Neighbour Cell Parameters
The Iu mode Neighbour Cell Parameters are used to specify Iu mode (and A/Gb mode) capable neighbouring cells (BA(GPRS)) and their corresponding cell selection parameters. The Iu mode Neighbour Cell Parameters are specified in PSI3 and in at least one instance of PSI3bis. If one instance of PSI3bis is not sufficient to specify the cell selection parameters of all Iu mode capable neighbouring cells, the remaining Iu mode capable neighbouring cells are specified in consecutive instances of PSI3bis. If all information fits within the PSI3 message, one instance of PSI3bis without any Iu mode Neighbour Cell Parameters is broadcast.
NOTE:	For efficient coding, cells with common cell selection parameters may be grouped together.
Building of BA(GPRS) is defined in sub-clause 5.6.3.2.
Iu mode Only Neighbour Cell Parameters
The Iu mode Only Neighbour Cell Parameters are used to specify Iu mode only capable neighbouring cells and their corresponding cell selection parameters. The Iu mode Only Neighbour Cell Parameters are specified in PSI3 and in at least one instance of PSI3bis. If one instance of PSI3bis is not sufficient to specify the cell selection parameters of all Iu mode only capable neighbouring cells, the remaining Iu mode only capable neighbouring cells are specified in consecutive instances of PSI3bis. If all information fits within the PSI3 message, one instance of PSI3bis without any Iu mode Only Neighbour Cell Parameters is broadcast.
Iu mode Neighbour Cell params struct
This struct presents supplementary information for Iu mode capable cells. The struct may be included in this message and assigns Iu mode parameter values to the neighbouring cells defined by the message. Iu mode capable neighbouring cells are defined by the Neighbour Cell Parameter IE. The Iu mode Neighbour Cell params struct values are assigned to the neighbouring cells in the same order they appear in the PSI3 and PSI3bis messages.

11.2.21	Packet System Information Type 3 bis
This message is sent by the network on the PBCCH and PACCH giving information of the BCCH allocation in the neighbour cells and cell selection parameters for non-serving cells. This message shall not be segmented across more than one RLC/MAC control block by using the procedures specified in sub-clause 9.1.12a. If not all information fits into one instance of the PSI3bis message, the PSI3bis message can be repeated. Special requirements for the transmission of this message apply on PBCCH, see 3GPP TS 45.002.

PAGE_MODE (2 bit field)
See description under PSI3.
PSI3_CHANGE_MARK (2 bit field)
See description under PSI3.
PSI3_BIS_INDEX (4 bit field)
The PSI3_BIS_INDEX field is used to distinguish individual PSI3 bis messages containing information about different neighbour cells. The field can take the binary representation of the values 0 to n, where n is the index of the last PSI3 bis message. (PSI3 bis count).
PSI3_BIS_COUNT (4 bit field)
See description under PSI3.
General rules for handling neighbour cell parameter default values
The first neighbour cell defined in the first PSI3bis instance uses as its default parameter values the parameter values defined for the last neighbour cell in PSI3. 
The following neighbour cells in PSI3bis use the parameter values of the previous neighbour cell as their default values. 
This principle of referring to the previous cell applies independently of the coding used in PSI3bis (Neighbour cell parameters, Neighbour cell parameters 2 and COMPACT Neighbour Cell Parameters).
This principle also applies when going from PSI3bis instance i over to PSI3bis instance i+1.
Neighbour cell params struct 
The coding of the Neighbour cell parameters is described under PSI3.
Neighbour cell params 2 struct
This coding may be used if the number of neighbour cells is high and many cells share common parameter values. The structure contains pointers to the list of sets of actual parameters. The coding of actual parameters that are contained in or referenced by the Neighbour Cell params 2 struct is described in PSI3.
COMPACT Neighbour Cell params struct
The coding of the Neighbour cell parameters is the same as the coding of the Neighbour cell params struct 2, except the two additional parameters, TIME_GROUP and GUAR_CONSTANT_PWR_BLKS. The coding of actual parameters that are contained in or referenced by the COMPACT Neighbour Cell params struct is described in PSI3.
The following parameters (CELL_PARAMS_POINTER, BCC and NCC) are not defined in PSI3:
CELL_PARAMS_POINTER (2 bit field)
Pointer to the parameter set valid for a certain cell group (up to four).
BCC (3 bit field)
BTS Colour Code.
Neighbour parameter set struct and COMPACT Neighbour parameter set struct
The actual parameter values for the Neighbour Cell params 2 struct and the COMPACT Neighbour Cell params struct are given is these structures. Default values for absent parameters are defined according to the general rule given above, except:
NCC : bit (3). Network Colour Code. The default value is given by the serving cell. 
LSA Parameters IE
The LSA Parameters IE is described under PSI3 and in sub-clause 12.28. 
CCN Support Description 
CCN_SUPPORTED (1 bit field) 
This parameter is used for determining whether the mobile station shall enter CCN mode when re-selecting a cell and CCN is enabled. The use of these bits is described in sub-clause 8.8.2a:

11.2.29.1	Special requirements in dual transfer mode for uplink TBF
Special requirements apply when an uplink TBF is assigned to a mobile station in dual transfer mode or about to enter dual transfer mode.
If the mobile station has an RR connection to the network on a half-rate TCH, the network may assign an uplink TBF using the other sub-channel of the same timeslot for a half-rate PDCH (see 3GPP TS 45.002). In this case, the uplink assignment message shall be encoded with a timeslot allocation including the timeslot number for the half-rate TCH and the half-rate PDCH, and only that timeslot number. The mobile station shall interpret this allocation as an allocation of a half-rate PDCH.
In dual transfer mode, the mobile station may be assigned an uplink TBF using exclusive allocation. The exclusive allocation shall be applied according to the conditions specified in sub-clause 8.1.0. When the exclusive allocation is applied, the mobile station shall ignore the USF values assigned in the uplink assignment message.
11.2.29a	Multiple TBF Uplink Assignment
This message is sent on the PACCH by the network to the mobile station to assign uplink resources. If the mobile station supports Downlink Dual Carrier, this message may be sent using extended RLC/MAC control message segmentation (see sub-clause 9.1.12a). The mobile station may be addressed by the G-RNTI or the TFI depending upon the procedure used. A mobile allocation or reference frequency list received as part of this assignment message shall be valid until new assignment is received or each TBF of the MS are terminated.

Power Control Parameters
This information element contains parameters necessary to define the radio resources of a dynamic allocation or an extended dynamic allocation in a multi carrier, RTTI, BTTI with FANR activated, or EGPRS2 configuration (see sub-clause 12.13).
In case of a timeslot allocation without power control parameters, the values of the power control parameters for assigned timeslots shall be the default values as specified in 3GPP TS 45.008. However, in case some of the timeslots assigned by this message are already used by the mobile station, the mobile station shall continue to use the current power control parameters for these timeslots.
For the case of a downlink carrier assigned for a DLMC configuration the assignment message shall provide the Power Control Parameters IE for at least the first carrier in the corresponding UFPS. If this IE is absent for any remaining carriers, the Power Control Parameters IE for the first carrier in the first UFPS shall apply.

This information field indicates the medium access mode to be used during the TBF.
0	Dynamic Allocation
1	Extended Dynamic Allocation
TBF Starting Time
The TBF Starting Time field contains a starting time that indicates the frame number during which the assigned TBF may start.
If no downlink TBF is in progress, the mobile station need not monitor the TFI field of downlink RLC data blocks until the indicated TDMA frame number. After the indicated TDMA frame number, the mobile station shall apply the new downlink parameters and then operate as during a downlink TBF. If a downlink TBF is already in progress, the mobile station shall continue to use the parameters of the existing TBF until the TDMA frame number occurs. When the indicated TDMA frame number occurs, the mobile station shall immediately begin to use the new downlink parameters assigned.
If no uplink TBF is in progress, the MS need not monitor the USF field until the TDMA frame number occurs. When the indicated TDMA frame number occurs, the mobile station shall immediately begin to monitor the USF field and use the new assigned uplink TBF parameters when its USF has occurred. If an uplink TBF is already in progress, the MS shall continue to use the parameters of the existing TBF until the TDMA frame number occurs. When the indicated TDMA frame number occurs, the mobile station shall immediately begin to monitor the USF field and use the new assigned uplink TBF parameters when its USF has occurred.
This field is encoded as the Starting Frame Number Description IE. See sub-clause 12.21
USF_TN0 (3 bit field)

ALPHA (4 bit field)
For encoding and description see the Global Power Control Parameters IE.
ALPHA_C1, ALPHA_C2 (4 bit field)
The usage of these fields is as specified in sub-clause 11.2.29.2.
GAMMA, GAMMA_TN (5 bit field)
This field is the binary representation of the parameter GCH for MS output power control in units of 2 dB, see 3GPP TS 45.008. The field is coded according to the following table:
bit
5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0 0	GCH = 0 dB
0 0 0 0 1	GCH = 2 dB
: : : :
1 1 1 1 0	GCH = 60 dB
1 1 1 1 1	GCH = 62 dB 
In the case of RTTI mode with BTTI USF, exactly one GAMMA field shall be included for each PDCH pair for which either one or two USF values are assigned.
USF_GRANULARITY (1 bit field)
This information field indicates the USF granularity to be applied by the mobile station when it is assigned a TBF using Dynamic Allocation or Extended Dynamic Allocation.

This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the downlink assignment for the DL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the downlink assignment for the TBF depends on the assigned DL Coverage Class and the Timeslot Multiplicator setting. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT field. The field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0	Timeslot 0 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
0 0 1	Timeslot 1 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
0 1 0	Timeslot 2 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
0 1 1	Timeslot 3 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
1 0 0 	Timeslot 4 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
1 0 1 	Timeslot 5 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
1 1 0 	Timeslot 6 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot
1 1 1 	Timeslot 7 is the lowest assigned downlink timeslot

A mobile station assigned CC2, CC3 or CC4 is always assigned 4 consecutive timeslots. Therefore only timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 may be indicated as the lowest assigned downlink timeslot when the assignment is for CC2, CC3 or CC4 in the downlink.
TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR (3 bit field)
This field defines how many DL timeslots that the assignment contains when the assigned DL Coverage Class, according to the DL_COVERAGE_CLASS field, is CC1. The field is coded according to the following table:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0	1 timeslot assigned
0 0 1	2 timeslots assigned
0 1 0	3 timeslots assigned
0 1 1	4 timeslots assigned
1 0 0	5 timeslots assigned
1 0 1	6 timeslots assigned
1 1 0	7 timeslots assigned
1 1 1	8 timeslots assigned
Values other than ‘000’ can only be used if supported by the mobile station, as indicated by its multislot capability, see 3GPP TS 45.002. If the assigned downlink Coverage Class > CC1 (according to the DL_COVERAGE_CLASS field), the mobile station shall consider the TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR field as not valid.
UL_COVERAGE_CLASS (2 bit field)
This field indicates the UL Coverage Class that is assigned for transfer of uplink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the DL EC TBF. The UL_COVERAGE_CLASS field shall be set according to the following table:

This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.74.
STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET (2 bit field)
This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the allocation that is used for transfer of uplink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the DL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the uplink allocation depends on the assigned UL Coverage Class. The allocated timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field. The STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded as an offset to the timeslot assigned with the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS fields in the same message.
If both DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the same timeslots are assigned in both the uplink and the downlink directions. The STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
If DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0	STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1		STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 3
If DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1 and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 1
1 0	STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 2
1 1		STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 3
If both DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the uplink is assigned to the timeslot indicated by the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT field. The STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
P0 (4 bit field)

This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the new assignment that is used for transfer of downlink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the UL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the downlink assignment depends on the assigned DL Coverage Class. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded as an offset to the timeslot assigned with the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS fields in the same message.
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the same timeslots are assigned in both the uplink and the downlink directions. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 2

bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 1
1 0	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 2
1 1		STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 3
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the downlink is assigned to the timeslot indicated by the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. If timer T3248 (sent in EC SI) is used, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field defines the lowest assigned timeslot for EC-PACCH transfers using CC2 while the timer is running. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is then encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1

BSN_OFFSET (2 bit field)
This field defines the offset, in the list of available RLC Data blocks for transmission, that shall be applied by the mobile station when selecting the RLC Data blocks to transmit in the fixed uplink allocation. If the BSN_OFFSET field is not present, the mobile station shall select the RLC Data blocks to transmit in the resources within the fixed uplink allocation as described in sub-clause 9.1.3.4. It shall e.g. start with the oldest NACKED block, if available, in the resources for the first RLC Data block within the fixed uplink allocation. If the BSN_OFFSET field is present, the mobile station shall apply an offset in RLC Data blocks and skip one, or several, of the RLC Data blocks that would be transmitted first according to the procedures in sub-clause 9.1.3.4.

Table 11.2.58.2: EC Packet UPlink ASSIGNMENT information element details
USED_DL_COVERAGE_CLASS (2 bit field)
This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.71.
Global TFI
This information element identifies the uplink TFI, if available, or the downlink TFI, to which this message applies. This field is defined in sub-clause 12.10.
EGPRS Modulation and Coding Scheme
The EGPRS Modulation and Coding Scheme information element is defined in sub-clause 12.10d. 
OVERLAID_CDMA_CODE (2 bit field)
The Overlaid CDMA Code field indicates the Overlaid CDMA Code that shall be used at transmissions during the uplink EC TBF, see 3GPP TS 45.002. This field is encoded according to the following table, see 3GPP TS 45.002 for definition of the codes:
bit
2 1
0 0	Overlaid CDMA Code 0
0 1	Overlaid CDMA Code 1
1 0	Overlaid CDMA Code 2
1 1		Overlaid CDMA Code 3
Note: Overlaid CDMA Code 0 corresponds to that the bursts are transmitted as if no code was applied.
UPLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT (5 bit field)
This information element, if present, assigns the contained TFI to the mobile station to identify the uplink TBF described by this message. This field is coded the same as the TFI field defined in sub-clause 12.15.
EC Packet Timing Advance
This information element is defined in sub-clause 12.74.
EC_MA_NUMBER (5 bit field)
This field indicates what EC Mobile Allocation set, as defined in the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 message, the TBF is allocated to (see 3GPP TS 44.018 [11]).
The field is encoded as a binary number with a range 0 to 31.
UL_COVERAGE_CLASS (2 bit field)
This field indicates the UL Coverage Class that is assigned for the UL EC TBF. The UL_COVERAGE_CLASS field shall be set according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	UL Coverage Class = CC1
0 1	UL Coverage Class = CC2
1 0	UL Coverage Class = CC3
1 1		UL Coverage Class = CC4
STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT (3 bit field)
This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the uplink assignment for the UL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the uplink assignment for the TBF depends on the assigned UL Coverage Class and the Timeslot Multiplicator setting. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. The field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0	Timeslot 0 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
0 0 1	Timeslot 1 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
0 1 0	Timeslot 2 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
0 1 1	Timeslot 3 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
1 0 0 	Timeslot 4 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
1 0 1 	Timeslot 5 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
1 1 0 	Timeslot 6 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot
1 1 1 	Timeslot 7 is the lowest assigned uplink timeslot

A mobile station assigned CC2, CC3 or CC4 is always assigned 4 consecutive timeslots. Therefore only timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 may be indicated as the lowest assigned uplink timeslot when the assignment is for CC2, CC3 or CC4 in the uplink.
TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR (3 bit field)
This field defines how many UL timeslots that the assignment contains when the assigned UL Coverage Class, according to the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS field, is CC1. The field is coded according to the following table:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0	1 timeslot assigned
0 0 1	2 timeslots assigned
0 1 0	3 timeslots assigned
0 1 1	4 timeslots assigned
1 0 0	5 timeslots assigned
1 0 1	6 timeslots assigned
1 1 0	7 timeslots assigned
1 1 1	8 timeslots assigned
Values other than ‘000’ can only be used if supported by the mobile station, as indicated by its multislot capability, see 3GPP TS 45.002. If the assigned uplink Coverage Class > CC1 (according to the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS field), the mobile station shall consider the TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR field as not valid
START_FIRST_UL_RLC_DATA_BLOCK (4 bit field)
This field indicates the starting position of the resources for the first allocated RLC Data block in the fixed uplink allocation. The starting position is relative to the first TDMA frame (N) of the downlink block containing the last blind physical layer transmission of this EC PACKET UPLINK ASSIGNMENT message, according to the USED_DL_COVERAGE_CLASS field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and the TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR fields in the same message.
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR = 0 or if UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC2, the START_FN_FIRST_UL_RLC_DATA_BLOCK field is encoded according to the following table:

In the transmission opportunity/ies between the previous uplink allocation and this allocation the mobile station is not allocated any resource, and shall thus not transmit.
This field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0				In the 2nd next transmission opportunity
0 0 1				In the 3rd next transmission opportunity
0 1 0				In the 4th next transmission opportunity

1 1 1 1 1		GCH = 62 dB
ALPHA Enable (1 bit field)
This field indicates whether or not the mobile station shall use the ALPHA parameter (if sent as part of EC SI) for uplink power control (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]). The field is coded as follows:
0		The mobile station shall not use the ALPHA parameter
1		The mobile station shall use the ALPHA parameter
P0 (4 bit field)
This field is an optional downlink power control parameter. It is encoded as follows:
bit
4 3 2 1 
0 0 0 0	P0 = 0 dB
0 0 0 1	P0 = 2 dB
0 0 1 0	P0 = 4 dB
:
1 1 1 1	P0 = 30 dB
PR_MODE (1 bit field)
This field indicates the PR Management mode, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008. The field is encoded as follows:
0	PR mode A: for one addressed MS
1	PR mode B: for all MSs
Primary TSC Set (1 bit field)
This field indicates to which TSC set the TSC field in the same message, for use on the assigned resources, shall be associated. This field is coded as follows:
0  TSC set 1
1   Indicates TSC set 2 for 8PSK modulation and TSC set 3 (which is identical to TSC set 3 used for the CS domain) for GMSK modulation. 

DL_COVERAGE_CLASS (2 bit field)
This field indicates the DL Coverage Class that is assigned for transfer of downlink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the UL EC TBF. The DL_COVERAGE_CLASS field shall be set according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	DL Coverage Class = CC1
0 1	DL Coverage Class = CC2
1 0	DL Coverage Class = CC3
1 1		DL Coverage Class = CC4
STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET (2 bit field)
This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the assignment that is used for transfer of downlink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the UL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the downlink assignment depends on the assigned DL Coverage Class. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded as an offset to the timeslot assigned with the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS fields in the same message.
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the same timeslots are assigned in both the uplink and the downlink directions. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1		STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 3
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1 and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 1
1 0	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 2
1 1		STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 3
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the downlink is assigned to the timeslot indicated by the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. If timer T3248 (sent in EC SI) is used, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field defines the lowest assigned timeslot for EC-PACCH transfers using CC2 while the timer is running. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is then encoded according to the following table:
bit
2 1
0 0	same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0	STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1		no valid CC2 mapping applies while T3248 is running, CC1 to be used

12.8.1	Abnormal cases
If the indirect encoding is used, this information element may contain the CHANGE_MARK_1 and 2 fields. If one of these fields is present, the receiver shall verify the validity of the PSI or SI change mark associated with the GPRS mobile allocation that the MA_NUMBER field refers to, see sub-clause 5.5.1.7. None of the CHANGE_MARK_1 and 2 fields shall be included if the MA_NUMBER refers to a GPRS mobile allocation received in a previous assignment message.
If the receiver detects that an inconsistency is contained in this information element, the information element shall be regarded as invalid. Such inconsistency may be that:
-	an invalid PSI or SI change mark is associated with the referred GPRS mobile allocation;
-	an CHANGE_MARK_1 or 2 field is included and the MA_NUMBER refers to a GPRS mobile allocation received in a previous assignment message; or
-	an undefined MA_NUMBER or an invalid GPRS Mobile Allocation is contained in this information element.
If the inconsistency is due to an invalid PSI or SI change mark associated with the referred GPRS mobile allocation or an undefined MA_NUMBER in the range 0 ñ 14, the mobile station shall initiate a partial acquisition of PBCCH or BCCH information (see sub-clause 5.5.1.4). It shall then obtain the PSI2 or SI13 information, which is concerned.
12.8.2	Dual Carrier Frequency Parameters
The Dual Carrier Frequency Parameters information element is used to define the frequency parameters for both carriers in a dual carrier configuration. It defines frequency parameters and a training sequence code (TSC), which may be allocated to a mobile station to define its channel configuration. All timeslots on each radio frequency channel in the channel configuration of the mobile station shall use the same frequency parameters and training sequence code.
The dual carrier frequency parameters may consist of two ARFCNs, defining non-hopping radio frequency channels. The dual carrier indirect encoding, the dual carrier direct encoding 1 and the dual carrier direct encoding 2 define two hopping radio frequency channels.

12.21	Starting Frame Number Description
There are two types of encoding for this IE : Relative Frame Number or Absolute Frame Number.
Table 12.21.1: Starting Frame Number Description information element
< Starting Frame Number Description IE > ::=
	{ 0 < Absolute Frame Number Encoding >
	| 1 < Relative Frame Number Encoding > } ;


If the mobile station is in packet transfer mode during the block immediately before the starting time and the lowest numbered PDCH assigned to the MS is different immediately before and after the starting time then the mobile station shall be ready to receive or transmit no later than one radio block from the starting time (see 3GPP TS 45.002).
12.21.1	Absolute Frame Number Encoding 
In this case, the field is encoded as the 16-bit Starting Time IE defined in 3GPP TS 44.018, and the value of the Starting FN is obtained directly.
If the Starting FN is not aligned to the start of a block period and the mobile station is in packet transfer mode during the TDMA immediately before the Starting FN, then the mobile station shall align the starting time to the next block boundary and continue to use the currently assigned allocation upto the next block boundary.
12.21.2	Relative Frame Number Encoding
In this case, the field indicates the delay, relative to the first TDMA frame (N) of the RLC/MAC block containing the Starting Time field, before the assigned or requested resource becomes valid.
The value of this field is the 13 bit binary representation of the integer k, from which the offset to be applied to N can be derived.
The value of the Starting Frame Number is calculated as follows:
For (k mod 3) equal to:
The value of the Starting Frame Number is:
0 or 1
N + 4 + 4 k + (k div3), N + 5 + 4k + (k div3)	(NOTE 1)
2
N + 5 + 4 k + (k div3)
0 £ k £ 8191

EXAMPLE:	Starting Frame Number Description (13-bit field):
k = 1	0000000000001	block with first TDMA frame number = N+8 or N+9
k = 2	0000000000010	block with first TDMA frame number = N+13
k = 3	0000000000011	block with first TDMA frame number = N+17 or N+18
NOTE 1:	In these cases, only one of the frame numbers N+4+4k+kdiv3 or N+5+4k+kdiv3 is valid, because the other corresponds to an idle frame, depending on the position of the block in the multi-frame.
NOTE 2:	The value of (k+1) gives the number of relative blocks. The maximum number of relative blocks is therefore 8 192; this value was chosen according to the interval of time encoded by the Starting Time IE in 3GPP TS 44.018 (32 024 frames).
NOTE 3:	The value (k=0) should not be used, so as to leave time for the MS to analyse the message and get ready to receive or transmit.

12.30	MS Radio Access Capability 2
The MS Radio Access Capability 2 information element is used to provide the radio part of the network with information concerning radio aspects of the mobile station. The contents may affect the manner in which the network handles the operation of the mobile station.
For the indication of the radio access capabilities the following conditions shall apply (see 3GPP TS 24.008 for the definition of the parameters):
-	Among the three Access Technology Types GSM 900-P, GSM 900-E and GSM 900-R the MS shall include only one access technology type denoting the GSM 900 band it supports. 
-	Due to shared radio frequency channel numbers between GSM 1800 and GSM 1900, the mobile station should provide the relevant radio access capability for either GSM 1800 band OR GSM 1900 band, not both. 
-	One of two different coding forms shall be used by the mobile station when indicating its radio access capabilities to the network: the regular coding is where all capabilities are indicated explicitly within an Access capabilities struct for each signalled access technology and the alternative coding where access technologies with same capabilities are indicated within the Additional access technologies struct (see 3GPP TS 24.008).
-	If the alternative coding by using the Additional access technologies struct is chosen by the mobile station, the mobile station shall indicate its radio access capability for the serving BCCH frequency band in the first included Access capabilities struct if this information element is not sent in response to an Access Technologies Request from the network or if none of the requested Access Technology Types is supported by the mobile station - see note 3. Otherwise, the mobile station shall include the radio access capabilities for the frequency bands it supports in the order of priority requested by the network as specified in sub-clause 7.1.3.2.
-	If this information element is sent during a GPRS TBF establishment, the mobile station should indicate as many as possible of its supported Access Technology Types. The maximum number of indicated Access Technology Types depends on the remaining bits left in the RLC/MAC message containing the MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE. The radio access capability for the serving BCCH frequency band shall be part of the indicated technologies, the inclusion of any other radio access capability is a mobile station implementation option.
-	If this information element is sent during an EGPRS TBF establishment, the mobile station shall indicate its supported Access Technology Types within the ones that are requested by the network or the access technology of the serving BCCH frequency band, as specified by the relevant procedures.
-	If the first instance of radio access capabilities information for a supported access technology type fits in its entirety using the Access capabilities struct of the MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE sent within the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the mobile station may use the alternative coding for encoding other access technology types that are provided within either the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message or the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message. In the case where the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message is sent to the network, the first Access Technology Type may be set to "1111".
-	If message size limitations prevent the first instance of access capabilities information for a supported access technology type from being provided in its entirety using the Access capabilities struct of the MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE sent within the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, the mobile station shall:
-	For this instance of access technology type, include as much of the access capabilities information as possible that can fit within the Access capabilities struct of the MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE sent within the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message. At minimum the mobile station shall provide up to and including its R99 access capabilities information within the Access capabilities struct. See note 1.
-	For this instance of access technology type, include the entire access capabilities information using the Access capabilities struct of the MS Radio Access Capability 2 IE sent within the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message (if this message is sent to the network). See note 2.
NOTE 1:	The mobile station has to set the ADDITIONAL MS RAC INFORMATION AVAILABLE bit to 1 in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message to signal that the instance of radio access capabilities provided in this message is incomplete - see sub-clauses 7.1.3.2 and 11.2.16.
NOTE 2:	Additional instances of access capabilities information for other access technology types may be described using either the Access capabilities struct (regular coding) or the Additional access technologies struct (alternative coding).
NOTE 3:	If the radio access capability for the serving BCCH frequency band has been included in its entirety in the PACKET RESOURCE REQUEST message, it should not be provided again in the ADDITIONAL MS RADIO ACCESS CAPABILITIES message, except in the cases specified in sub-clause 7.1.3.2.1 where this message is sent in response to a request from the network.

This information field indicates the medium access mode to be used during the TBF.
0	Dynamic Allocation
1	Extended Dynamic Allocation
P0_C1, P0_C2 (4 bit field)
These fields are optional downlink power control parameters. 
If the Assignment Type field is present and indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment', P0_C1 and P0_C2 apply to carrier 1 and carrier 2, respectively. The presence of these parameters indicates that downlink power control is used for the indicated carrier; otherwise, downlink power control is not used for the indicated carrier. If the P0_C1 IE is present but the P0_C2 IE is absent, then the P0_C1 IE shall apply also to carrier 2. 
If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then P0_C1 shall apply to the carrier specified in the Carrier ID field.
These fields are encoded as follows:
bit
4 3 2 1 
0 0 0 0	P0 = 0 dB
0 0 0 1	P0 = 2 dB
0 0 1 0	P0 = 4 dB

1 1 1 1	P0 = 30 dB
PR_MODE_C1, PR_MODE_C2 (1 bit field)
These fields indicate the PR Management mode, as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.
If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then PR_MODE_C1 shall apply to the carrier specified in the Carrier ID field. Otherwise, PR_MODE_C1 and PR_MODE_C2 shall apply to carrier 1 and carrier 2 respectively. If the Assignment Type field indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment and the PR_MODE_C1 IE is present but the PR_MODE_C2 IE is absent, then the PR_MODE_C1 IE shall apply also to carrier 2. It is encoded as follows:
0	PR mode A: for one addressed MS
1	PR mode B: for all MS
USF_GRANULARITY (1 bit field)
This information field indicates the USF granularity to be applied by the mobile station when it is assigned a TBF using Dynamic Allocation or Extended Dynamic Allocation.
0	the mobile station shall transmit one RLC/MAC block
1	the mobile station shall transmit four consecutive RLC/MAC blocks
UPLINK_TFI_ASSIGNMENT (5 bit field)
This information element, if present, assigns the contained TFI to the mobile station to identify an uplink TBF described by this message. This field is coded the same as the TFI field defined in sub-clause 12.15. 
N_USF, N_TS (4 bit field)
N_PAIRS (3 bit field)
These fields indicate respectively the number of USF, timeslots or PDCH pairs assigned to a given uplink TBF. The number of timeslots or PDCH pairs is given as the binary value of the corresponding field plus one.

See Annex K for details of the coding of these fields.

ALPHA_C1, ALPHA_C2 (4 bit field)
If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Assignment on single carrier only' or 'Modification of existing assignment', then ALPHA_C1 (if present) shall apply to the carrier specified in the Carrier ID field. 
If the Assignment Type field is included and indicates 'Dual Carrier assignment', ALPHA_C1 and ALPHA_C2 indicate the value of the parameter alpha to be applied in power control on carrier 1 and carrier 2 respectively. For encoding and description see the Global Power Control Parameters IE. If ALPHA_C1 is present and ALPHA_C2 is absent, then ALPHA_C1 shall apply to carrier 2.
USF, USF_2 (3 bit field)
These fields indicate the USF values assigned to a given TBF for the assigned timeslot or PDCH pair.

In the case of RTTI mode with BTTI USF, the USF value specified in the USF field (respectively USF_2 field) applies to the first two (respectively second two) TDMA frames of the following basic radio block period (see sub-clauses 8.1.1.1, 8.1.1.2.1).

These fields are encoded as a binary representation of the USF value as defined in sub-clause 10.4.1.

The order in which USF assignments are encoded and the meaning when the number of repetitions of the USF is lower than the maximum is described in Annex K.

GAMMA (5 bit field)
This  field is the binary representation of the parameter GCH for MS output power control in units of 2 dB, see 3GPP TS 45.008. The field is coded according to the following table:

Table 12.66.2: DLMC Channel Quality Report information element details
DLMC Interference Measurements
These information elements provide interference measurement information for a MS in a DLMC configuration. The MS provides this information for the downlink carrier indicated by the assignment message or the lowest numbered downlink carrier if carrier information for interference measurements is not provided by the assignment message.

C_VALUE
If the parameter PC_MEAS_CHAN (see sub-clause 12.9) indicates downlink measurements for power control shall be made on BCCH, a single instance of this field shall be reported using BCCH Carrier measurements (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [15] regarding C_VALUE determination). If PC_MEAS_CHAN indicates that the downlink measurements for power control shall be made on PDCH, a single instance of this field shall be reported for the carrier/UFPS on which the MS was polled.

DLMC BEP Link Quality Measurements
If the DLMC Measurement Type field (see sub-clause 11.2.7) in the last received assignment message indicates measurement information is to be reported on a per UFPS basis the measurements are reported starting with the UFPS on which the MS was polled followed by additional higher numbered UFPS (if any) beginning with the next in sequence UFPS. 
If the DLMC Measurement Type field (see sub-clause 11.2.7) in the last received assignment message indicates measurement information is to be reported on a per carrier basis the measurements are reported starting with the carrier on which the MS was polled followed by additional higher numbered carriers (if any) beginning with the next in sequence carrier. 
The number of UFPS/carriers reported is determined by the space available in the reporting message (see sub-clause 9.1.8.2.1). If RLC/MAC blocks have not been received on a given UFPS/carrier since the last reporting period it shall still be listed in but no measurement results shall be included.
DLMC BEP_MEASUREMENTS
This field is included when the DLMC Measurement Type field (see sub-clause 11.2.7) in the last received assignment message indicates measurement information is to be reported on a per carrier basis and the  LINK_QUALITY_MEASUREMNT_MODE field (see sub-clause 11.2.7) received in the same assignment message indicates the mobile station shall report the mean BEP on each assigned time slot. When included it only provides information for each timeslot assigned to the carrier on which the MS was polled.
