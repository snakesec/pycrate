9	Message functional definitions and contents
This sub-clause defines the structure of the messages of those layer 3 protocols defined in 3GPP TS 44.018. These are standard L3 messages as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007 with the exception of those sent on the SCH, RACH, and the HANDOVER ACCESS message.
Each definition given in the present sub-clause includes:
a)	a brief description of the message direction and use, including whether the message has:
1.	Local significance, i.e. relevant only on the originating or terminating access;
2.	Access significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access, but not in the network;
3.	Dual significance, i.e. relevant in either the originating or terminating access and in the network; or
4.	Global significance, i.e. relevant in the originating and terminating access and in the network.
b)	a table listing the information elements known in the message and their order of their appearance in the message. All information elements that may be repeated are explicitly indicated. (V and LV formatted IEs, which compose the imperative part of the message, occur before T, TV, and TLV formatted IEs which compose the non-imperative part of the message, cf. 3GPP TS 24.007.) In a (maximal) sequence of consecutive information elements with half octet length, the first information element with half octet length occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N+1 etc. Such a sequence always has an even number of elements.
	For each information element the table indicates:
1.	the information element identifier, in hexadecimal notation, if the IE has format T, TV, or TLV. Usually, there is a default IEI for an information element type; default IEIs of different IE types of the same protocol are different. If the IEI has half octet length, it is specified by a notation representing the IEI as a hexadecimal digit followed by a "-" (example: B-).
NOTE	The same IEI may be used for different information element types in different messages of the same protocol.
2.	the name of the information element (which may give an idea of the semantics of the element). The name of the information element (usually written in italics) followed by "IE" or "information element" is used in 3GPP TS 44.018 as reference to the information element within a message.
3.	the name of the type of the information element (which indicates the coding of the value part of the IE), and generally, the referenced sub-clause of clause 10 of 3GPP TS 44.018 describing the value part of the information element.
4.	the presence requirement indication (M, C, or O) for the IE as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.
5.	The format of the information element (T, V, TV, LV, TLV) as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.
6.	The length of the information element (or permissible range of lengths), in octets, in the message, where "?" means that the maximum length of the IE is only constrained by link layer protocol. This indication is non-normative.
c)	sub-clauses specifying, where appropriate, conditions for IEs with presence requirement C or O in the relevant message which together with other conditions specified in 3GPP TS 44.018 define when the information elements shall be included or not, what non-presence of such IEs means, and - for IEs with presence requirement C - the static conditions for presence and/or non-presence of the IEs (cf. 3GPP TS 24.007).

9.1.2.1	Mode of the First Channel (Channel Set 1) and Mode of Channel Set "X" (2=<X=<8)
If this information element is not present the channel mode of the previously allocated channel or channels for Channel Set "X" (1=<X<=8) shall be assumed.
If Channel Set "X" is not defined for the configuration, the Mode of Channel Set "X" IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
NOTE:	Sub-clause 3.4.3.1 defines cases when one or several Mode of Channel Set "X" IEs shall be included in the message.
9.1.2.2	Description of the Second Channel
These information elements appear in the case of an assignment occurring if the mobile station carries two connections (on two dedicated channels, for the TCH/H + TCH/H configuration).
The connection using the channel previously defined in the Description of the First Channel IEs of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or HANDOVER COMMAND message shall use the channel defined in the Description of the First Channel IEs of the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message defining the new configuration.
The channel described in the Description of the First Channel IEs carries the main DCCH. The SACCH used is the one associated with that channel.
9.1.2.3	Mode of the Second Channel
If no Description of the Second Channel IE is present but the information element is present it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
This information element appears at least when the channel mode is changed for the channel defined in the second channel description information elements.
9.1.2.4	Mobile Allocation and Frequency List, after the starting time
If at least one of the channel descriptions for the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present and apply to all assigned channels:
-	Mobile Allocation, after time;
-	Frequency List, after time.
If neither of the Channel Description IEs for after time indicate frequency hopping, if decoding of Channel Description IEs for before time does not require a frequency list for after time (see next sub-clause), and one or both of the two information elements are present they shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.
9.1.2.5	Starting Time
The starting time information element is included when the network wants the mobile station to change the frequency parameters of the channels more or less at the moment a change of channel occurs. In this case a number of information elements may be included to give the frequency parameters to be used before the starting time.
If the starting time information element is present and none of the information elements referring to before the starting time are present, the mobile station waits and accesses the channels at the indicated time.
If the starting time information element is present and at least one of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, the mobile station does not wait for the indicated time and accesses the channel using the frequency parameters for before the starting time.
If the starting time information element is not present and at some of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, these information elements shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.
If the description of the first channel, before time IE is not present, the channel description to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the description of the first channel, after time IE.
If the description of the second channel, after time IE is present, the description of the second channel, before time IE not present, and a description of the configuration for before the time needed, the channel configuration before the starting time is nevertheless of two traffic channels, and the channel description to apply to the second channel before the starting time is given by the description of the second channel, after time IE.
If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements may be present and applies before the starting time to all assigned channels:
-	Mobile Allocation, before time IE;
-	Frequency list, before time IE;
-	Frequency channel sequence, before time IE.
If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, and none of the above mentioned IE is present, a frequency list for after the starting time must be present (see sub-clause 9.1.2.4), and this list applies also for the channels before the starting time.
9.1.2.6	Reference cell frequency list
If any of the mobile allocation information elements is present, then the network must ensure that either the mobile station has received in a previous message the proper reference cell frequency list (CA), or that the cell channel description IE is present.
If the cell channel description IE is present, it is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in the message, as well as in later messages until reception of a new reference cell frequency list or the cell is left.
9.1.2.7	Cell Channel Description
If present, this information element shall be used to decode the Mobile Allocation IE in the same message and in subsequent messages.
9.1.2.8	Cipher Mode Setting
If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channel.
Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:
-	The cipher mode setting IE shall not be included if the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is sent on a VGCS channel or dedicated channel in order to assign a VGCS channel.
-	The cipher mode setting IE shall be included if the ASSIGNMENT COMMAND message is sent on a ciphered VGCS channel in order to assign a dedicated channel. If the information element is not present, the MS shall use ciphering mode "no ciphering" on the assigned channel.
9.1.2.9	VGCS target mode Indication
This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".
This IE indicates which mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.
The IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.
NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS talking shall not consider a syntactical error when this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.
9.1.2.10	Description of the multislot allocation
This information element is included if so indicated by the channel type and TDMA offset field in the Channel Description information element and is used to assign channels that do not carry a main signalling link in a multislot configuration. It indicates how the used timeslots are divided into separate channel sets.
If the Channel Description IE does not require the presence of the information element the Description of the multislot allocation IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
If multislot configuration is indicated by the Channel Description IE but the Multislot Allocation IE is not present, all channels in the configuration belong to one channel set, "Channel Set 1".
NOTE:	As a change of timeslot number cannot occur for the channel described after the starting time, the Multislot Allocation IE does not have to be included more than once.
9.1.2.11	Multi Rate configuration
This information element appears if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. it is different from the MultiRateconfiguration of a previously allocated channel in the cell.
9.1.2.12	VGCS Ciphering Parameters
This information element is only applicable to a VGCS mobile station. It is only included if the assigned resource is ciphered using VGCS ciphering.
9.1.2.13	Extended TSC Set, after time
If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Description of the First Channel, after time IE shall apply.
9.1.2.14	Extended TSC Set, before time
If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources. In the absence of this information element the TSC related information provided by the Description of the First Channel, before time IE shall apply. If the Description of the First Channel, before time IE is not present, the TSC related information to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the Extended TSC Set, after time IE.

9.1.5.1	Channel Description
This is sufficient to identify the channel in the case of a TCH/H + TCH/H configuration. If used for a multislot configuration, the IE shall describe the present channel configuration with TN indicating the main channel. The IE shall not indicate a new channel configuration when included in the Channel Mode Modify message.
9.1.5.2	VGCS target mode Indication
This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".
This IE indicates which RR mode is to be used with the new channel mode (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the RR mode shall be the same as with the previous channel mode.
When the RR mode of the new channel mode is group transmit mode, the IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as with the previous channel mode.
NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS Talking shall not consider a syntactical error if this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.
9.1.5.3	Multi Rate configuration
This information element appears if the Channel Mode IE indicates a multi-rate speech codec.
9.1.5.4	VGCS Ciphering Parameters
This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talker. It is only included if the assigned resource is ciphered using VGCS ciphering.
9.1.5.5	Extended TSC Set
If the message is sent to a mobile station that indicates support for extended TSC sets (see 3GPP TS 24.008 [79]) this information element may be included to provide TSC related information for the assigned radio resources.

NOTE 1:	The network may only send either the Group Channel Description or the Group Channel Description 2 element. 
9.1.7.1	Group Channel Description / Group Channel Description 2
If a CHANNEL RELEASE is sent to a mobile station which is in dedicated mode and which is involved in a voice group call or has responded to a notification to a voice group call or voice broadcast call, a group channel description (or group channel description 2) may be included, describing the voice group call channel or voice broadcast channel to which the mobile station shall go after the channel release procedure.
Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore the group channel description (or group channel description 2)information element if present.
9.1.7.2	Group Cipher Key Number
This IE may be present only if the Group channel description IE or the Group Channel Description 2 IE is provided. The presence of these IE indicates that the mobile station shall use the Group Cipher Key indicated by the Group Cipher Key Number IE for deciphering on the VGCS or VBS channel. If these IE are not present, no ciphering is applied on the VGCS or VBS channel.
Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this information element.
9.1.7.3	UTRAN Freq List
This IE should only be sent to UTRAN capable mobile station. This information element is used to describe the UTRAN frequencies used by the network.
9.1.7.4	Cell Channel Description
This IE may be present if the following conditions are satisfied:
-	the CHANNEL RELEASE message is ordering the release of the uplink to the originator or to the talker of a VGCS call over a dedicated channel; and
-	the Group Channel Description IE is included in the message and is describing a hopping channel.
It shall not be included in any other case.
Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking or VGCS originating shall ignore this information element if present.
9.1.7.5	VGCS Ciphering Parameters
This information element is only applicable to a VGCS mobile station. It is only included if the group channel is ciphered.
9.1.7.6	Talker Identity
This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talking subscriber. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore this information element if present.
9.1.7.7	Talker Priority Status

9.1.7.8	VGCS AMR Configuration
This information element is only applicable to a VGCS talking subscriber. Mobile stations not supporting VGCS talking shall ignore this information element if present.
9.1.7.9	Individual priorities
This information element is sent to provide MS-specific priorities for priority-based cell reselection. The individual priorities shall override the priorities received through system information or individual priorities received previously. The timer T3230 is used to control the availability of the individual priorities.
9.1.8	Channel request
This message is sent in random mode on the RACH. It does not follow the basic format. The possible formats are presented directly below, without reference to information fields. The order of bit transmission is defined in 3GPP TS 44.004.
The message is only one octet long, coded as shown in figure 9.1.8.1 and table 9.1.8.1.

Figure 9.1.8.1: CHANNEL REQUEST message content
ESTABLISHMENT CAUSE (octet 1)
This information field indicates the reason for requesting the establishment of a connection. This field has a variable length (from 3 bits up to 6 bits).
RANDOM REFERENCE (octet 1)
This is an unformatted field with variable length (from 5 bits down to 2 bits).
The Channel Request message is coded as follows:

NOTE 1:	Examples of these procedures are: IMSI detach, Short Message Service (SMS), Supplementary Service management, Location Services, sending of application-specific data.
NOTE 2:	If such messages are received by a network, an SDCCH shall be allocated.
NOTE 2a:	If such messages are received by a network, an SDCCH may be allocated.
NOTE 2b:	This value shall not be used by the mobile station on RACH. If such message is received by the network, it may be ignored. The value is used by the network to answer to a 11 bits EGPRS Packet Channel request.
NOTE 2c:	If the MS is Location Updating as part of a CS Fallback Mobile Originating call setup then the MS shall instead use the appropriate Originating call Establishment cause value. If the MS is Location Updating as part of a CS Fallback for other Mobile Originating services (e.g. USSD or Location Services) then the MS may either use the Establishment cause for the other service or the Establishment cause for Location Updating. If the MS is Location Updating as part of a Mobile Terminating CS Fallback procedure then the MS shall instead use the appropriate Answer to paging Establishment cause value as specified below Table 9.1.8.2.

In case of a CHANNEL REQUEST triggered within a CS Fallback procedure, see 3GPP TS 23.272, the CHANNEL REQUEST message content shall be based on the relevant information provided in the paging notification received in source RAT, see 3GPP TS 24.301, as for a Paging Indication (see  Table 9.1.8.2) set to:
-	"TCH/H or TCH/F" if the mobile station is paged for a speech call or for any other CS service requiring a traffic channel,
-	"SDCCH" if the mobile station is paged for a supplementary service transaction, a terminating location services request or any other CS service that can be completed with an SDCCH,
-	"Any channel" otherwise (including where no relevant information is provided in the paging notification).
NOTE 3:	The Paging Indication is provided by the Channel Needed IE (or the Channel Needed field) associated with the page which triggered the sending of the CHANNEL REQUEST message.
NOTE 4:	In some cases the established connection will be used only to allow a default rejection mechanism to take place (typically the mobile station will send a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause #88 "incompatible destination" as an answer to the incoming SETUP message).
NOTE 5:	In this sub-clause, "dual rate capability" means that the MS supports both full rate and half-rate channels at least for the signalling channel mode. In addition, it may support either speech channel mode, or data channel modes, or both on half-rate channels.
9.1.9	Ciphering mode command
This message is sent on the main DCCH from the network to the mobile station to indicate that the network has started deciphering and that enciphering and deciphering shall be started in the mobile station, or to indicate that ciphering will not be performed. See table 9.1.9.1.

9.1.15.1	Synchronization Indication
If this information element does not appear, the assumed value is "non-synchronized".
9.1.15.2	Mode of the First Channel (Channel Set 1) and Mode of Channel Set "X" (2=<X<=8)
If this information element is not present the channel mode of the previously allocated channel or channels for Channel Set "X" (1=<X<=8) shall be assumed.
If Channel Set "X" is not defined for the configuration, the Mode of Channel Set "X" IE shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
NOTE:	Sub-clause 3.4.4.1 defines cases when one or several Mode of Channel Set "X" IEs shall be included in the message.
9.1.15.3	Description of the Second Channel
These information element appear if the mobile station carries two connections (on two dedicated channels, for the TCH/H+TCH/H configuration).
The connection using the channel previously defined in the Description of the First Channel IE of an ASSIGNMENT COMMAND or HANDOVER COMMAND message shall use the channel defined in the first channel description IE of the HANDOVER COMMAND message defining the new configuration.
The channel described in the Description of the First Channel IE carries the main DCCH. The SACCH used is the one associated with that channel.
9.1.15.4	Mode of the Second Channel
If the Description of the Second Channel IE is not present and the information element is present it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
This element appears at least when the channel mode is changed for the channel defined in the Description of the Second Channel information element.
9.1.15.5	Frequency Channel Sequence, Frequency List, Frequency short list and Mobile Allocation, after time.
If at least one of the channel descriptions for after time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements shall be present:
-	Frequency Channel Sequence, after time;
-	Frequency list, after time;
-	Frequency Short List, after time;
-	Mobile Allocation, after time.
If neither of the Channel Description IEs indicate frequency hopping, if they are not required for the decoding of Channel Description IEs for before time, and if any of the four information elements are present they shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.
The Frequency Channel Sequence information element shall not be used unless all the ARFCNs that it indicates are in the P-GSM band.
9.1.15.6	Starting Time
The starting time information element is included when the network wants the mobile station to change the frequency parameters of the channels more or less at the moment a change of channel occurs. In this case a number of information elements may be included to give the frequency parameters to be used before the starting time.
The starting time information element refers to the new cell time.
If the starting time information element is present and none of the information elements referring to before the starting time are present, the mobile station waits and accesses the channels at the indicated time.
If the starting time information element is present and at least one of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, the mobile station does not wait for the indicated time and accesses the channel using the frequency parameters for before the starting time.
If the starting time information element is not present and some of the information elements referring to before the starting time is present, these information elements shall be considered as IEs unnecessary in the message.
If the description of the first channel, before time IE is not present, the channel description to apply for before the time, if needed, is given by the description of the first channel, after time IE.
If the description of the second channel, after time IE is present, the description of the second channel, before time IE not present, and a description of the configuration for before the time needed, the channel configuration before the starting time is nevertheless of two traffic channels, and the channel description to apply to the second channel before the starting time is given by the description of the second channel, after time IE.
If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, one and only one of the following information elements may be present and applies before the starting time to all assigned channels:
-	Mobile Allocation, before time IE;
-	Frequency Short list, before time IE;
-	Frequency list, before time IE;
-	Frequency channel sequence, before time IE.
If the starting time IE is present and at least one of the channel descriptions for before the starting time indicates frequency hopping, and none of the above mentioned IE is present, a frequency list for after the starting time must be present (see sub-clause 9.1.2.4), and this list applies also for the channels before the starting time.
9.1.15.7	Reference cell frequency list
If any of the mobile allocation information elements is present, then the cell channel description IE must be present. It is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in the message.
In addition, if no information elements pertaining to before the starting time is present in the message, the frequency list defined by the cell channel description IE is used to decode the mobile allocation IEs in later messages received in the new cell until reception of a new reference cell frequency list or the new cell is left.
9.1.15.8	Real Time Difference
This information element shall appear if the Synchronization Indication information element indicates a pseudo-synchronous handover otherwise it shall be considered as an unnecessary information element.
9.1.15.9	Timing Advance
This information element shall appear if the "synchronization indication" element indicates a presynchronized handover. If not included for a presynchronized handover, then the default value as defined in 3GPP TS 45.010 shall be used. For other types of handover it shall be considered as an unnecessary information element.
9.1.15.10	Cipher Mode Setting
If this information element is omitted, the mode of ciphering is not changed after the mobile station has switched to the assigned channel.
In the case of inter-RAT or inter-mode handover to GERAN A/Gb mode, the HANDOVER COMMAND message shall always contain the cipher mode setting IE (see sub-clause 3.4.4.1).
Only applicable for mobile stations supporting VGCS talking:
The cipher mode setting IE shall not be included if the HANDOVER COMMAND message is sent on a VGCS channel or on a dedicated channel for a handover to a VGCS channel.
The cipher mode setting IE shall be included if the HANDOVER COMMAND message is sent on a ciphered VGCS channel for a handover to a dedicated channel. If the information element is not present, the MS shall use ciphering mode "no ciphering" on the assigned channel.
9.1.15.11	VGCS target mode indication
This information element is identified as "comprehension required". Only mobile stations supporting "VGCS talking" are required to accept the presence of the element. The presence of the element shall trigger an exception handling if received by a mobile station not supporting "VGCS talking".
This IE indicates which mode is to be used on the new channel (i.e. dedicated mode or group transmit mode). If this information element is not present, the mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.
The IE also indicates the group cipher key number for the group cipher key to be used on the new channel or if the new channel is non ciphered. If the information element is not present, the ciphering mode shall be the same as on the previous channel.
NOTE:	A mobile station supporting VGCS Talking shall not consider a syntactical error if this IE is present and the channel mode is not speech.
9.1.15.12	Description of the multislot allocation
This information element is included if so indicated by the channel type and TDMA offset field in the Channel Description information element and is used to assign channels that do not carry a main signalling link in a multislot configuration. It indicates how the used timeslots are divided into separate channel sets.
If the Channel Description IE does not require the presence the information element it shall be considered as an IE unnecessary in the message.
If multislot configuration is indicated by the Channel Description IE but the Multislot Allocation IE is not present, all channels in the configuration belong to one channel set, "Channel Set 1".
NOTE:	As a change of timeslot number cannot occur for the channel described for after the starting time, the Multislot Allocation IE does not have to be included more than once.
9.1.15.13	MultiRateconfiguration
This information element appears if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and if the assigned configuration is new, i.e. it is different from the MultiRateconfiguration used in the serving cell. 
In the case of a handover from a GERAN cell, if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, and this IE is not included, then the mobile station shall assume that the MultiRateconfiguration has not changed.
In the case of an intersystem handover to GERAN, if the Mode of the First Channel indicates a multi-rate speech codec, this IE shall be included. If not included in this case, the mobile station shall act as defined in sub-clause 3.4.4.1.
9.1.15.14	Dynamic ARFCN Mapping
This information element should only be included if the network supports dynamic ARFCN mapping and there is a need to define new dynamic ARFCN mapping, e.g. at handover to another PLMN or from another RAT to GSM. This information replaces any previously received information about dynamic ARFCN mapping. After returning to idle mode or packet idle mode, the mobile station shall acquire new dynamic ARFCN mapping information, except for the cases specified in sub-clause 3.2.2.1 (SI15). This mapping shall apply to any ARFCN used in the same message.

NOTE:	Index 1 refers to the first mobile station, index 2 refers to the second MS and so on.
9.1.20.1	Use of the indexes
A request reference information element and the following wait indication information element refer to the same mobile station. So it is possible to reject up to four channel requests with this message.
9.1.20.2	Filling of the message
If necessary the request reference information element and the wait indication information element should be duplicated to fill the message.
9.1.20.2a	Request Reference
When set to the value '0111 1111', the RA information of the Request Reference i IE indicates that an Extended RA i field may be included in the IAR Rest Octets. The mobile station shall use the information in the Extended RA i field to identify the Immediate Assignment Reject message corresponding to an EGPRS Packet Channel Request message. If the Extended RA i field is not included, the mobile station shall assume that the Request Reference i IE does not correspond to the EGPRS Packet Channel Request message.
When the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060), it shall ignore the contents of all the Request Reference i IEs and regard them as unnecessary IEs.
9.1.20.3	Wait Indication
When IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message is for RR connection establisment then this IE contains timeout value for T3122. If IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message is for TBF establisment for GPRS MS then this IE contain timeout value for T3142.
When the mobile station receives the IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT REJECT message encapsulated in the PACKET CS COMMAND message on the PACCH (see 3GPP TS 44.060), it shall ignore the contents of the Wait Indication 2, 3 and 4 IEs and regard them as unnecessary IEs.
9.1.20.4	IAR Rest Octets
The sum of the length of this IE and the L2 Pseudo Length of the message equals 22.

9.1.21a	Notification/FACCH
The understanding of this message is only required for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.
This message is sent on the main DCCH, in unacknowledged mode using the RR short protocol discriminator by the network to notify the mobile stations in dedicated mode or in on-going voice broadcast calls or voice group calls on other voice broadcast calls or voice group calls in that cell.
Notification/FACCH messages for VBS or VGCS calls are differentiated by a flag in the call reference.
It is possible in the case of a notification for a ciphered VGCS/VBS call that the notification cannot be described within one Notification/FACCH message. In this case a second message may be used to contain the group call reference, a VSTK_RAND, possibly the CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT and bit 22 of COUNT. The group channel description shall be in the first segment.
Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this message.

The understanding of this message is only required for mobile stations supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening.
This message is sent on the NCH by the network to notify mobile stations of VBS or VGCS calls in the current cell. The VBS or VGCS calls are identified by their broadcast call reference or group call reference, respectively. For each reference, the corresponding VBS or VGCS call channel may be indicated. See table 9.1.21b.1.
Notification/NCH messages for VBS or VGCS calls are differentiated by a flag in the call reference.
The L2 pseudo length of this message has a value one.
It is possible in the case of a notification for a ciphered VGCS/VBS call that the notification cannot be described within one message. In this case a second message may be used to contain the group call reference, a VSTK_RAND, and possibly CELL_GLOBAL_COUNT. The Group channel description shall be included in the first segment.
Mobile stations not supporting VGCS listening or VBS listening shall ignore this message.

BSIC, base station identity code is a 9 bit field identifying the base station (see 3GPP TS 45.002).
T1' and T2', these are 2 parts of the reduced TDMA frame number per quarter hyperframe (RFNQH) as specified in 3GPP TS 45.002[32].
RACH Access Control is a 1 bit field, is only applicable to mobile stations that have selected CC1 on both the uplink and downlink (i.e. all other mobile stations shall ignore this field) and is coded as follows:
0: 	A mobile station that has selected CC1 in both uplink and downlink shall use the EC_CCCH_GROUP (i.e. one of timeslots 1, 3, 5 or 7 - see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]) to transmit the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
1: 	A mobile station that has selected CC1 in both uplink and downlink shall use timeslot 0 to transmit the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST
EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK is a 3 bit field that operates as a modulo 8 counter and is therefore incremented each time the content of any of the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION messages is changed. An exception is when PLMN specific access barring is enabled (see sub-clause 3.5.2a) for a given set of PLMNs and changes are made only to the EC_Access_Control_Class field or the Exception_Report_Status field corresponding to this set of PLMNs in which case the EC-BCCH CHANGE MARK field is not incremented.
Implicit Reject Status is a 2 bit field and is coded as follows:
00:	no barring
01:	roamer barring enabled for all mobile stations that are neither in their HPLMN nor in a PLMN that is equivalent to it (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [6]).
10:	roamer  barring enabled for all mobile stations that are neither in the PLMN listed as most preferred PLMN of the country where the MS is roaming in the operator-defined PLMN selector list on the SIM/USIM, nor in their HPLMN nor in an PLMN that is equivalent to it (see 3GPP TS 22.011 [6]).
11:	all mobile stations barred. Only applies to MS with Access Class 0 to 9 (see 3GPP TS 22.011)

Figure 9.1.43p.1: EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 message content
Table 9.1.43p.1: EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 information element details
Message Type (3 bits)
The Message Type field is encoded according to Table 10.4 .4.
EC SI 1_INDEX (2 bits) and EC SI 1_COUNT (2 bits)
The purpose of these fields is to indicate the number of individual message instances within the sequence of EC SI 1 messages and to assign an index to identify each instance. The EC SI 1_INDEX field is binary coded, range 0 to 3, and provides an index to identify an individual EC SI 1 message instance. The EC SI 1_COUNT field is binary coded, range 0 to 3, and provides the value of the highest indexed message instance in the sequence of EC SI 1 messages.
EC SI_CHANGE_MARK (5 bits)
This field contains a bitmap indicating the status of each EC SI message broadcasted in the cell. Whenever the content of a given EC SI message is modified the associated bit position within the bitmap (EC SI N) is changed to "0" or "1" depending on its previous value; N = 1, 2, 3, 4. 
An Overflow Control bit (bit 1 in the bitmap) indicates whether one or more of the EC SI messages have changed more than once during a given time period (see sub-clause 3.10.4).
The EC SI_CHANGE_MARK field is encoded as follows.
Bits
5 4 3 2 1
x x x x x		EC SI 4	EC SI 3	EC SI 2	EC SI 1	Overflow Control bit
EC Cell Channel Description struct
The EC Cell Channel Description struct identifies the list of frequencies in the serving cell.
NumberOfOctets (5 bits)
This field indicates the number of octets used to provide the serving cell frequency list information.
It is coded as follows:
Bits
5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0 0 	1 octet
0 0 0 0 1 	2 octets
…
1 1 1 1 1 	32 octets
Frequency List Information
This field defines the radio frequency channels in the cell as a set of ARFCNs. It consists of the value part of the Frequency List IE defined in sub-clause 10.5.2.13. The value part starts from octet 3 and the length of the value part is determined by the NumberOfOctets field.
The number of radio frequency channels (ARFCNs) included in the Frequency List Information field (excluding any duplication of ARFCN) is denoted NF. The radio frequency channels provided in one or more instances of this message shall be arranged by the receiver of this field in the order of ascending ARFCN, except for ARFCN = 0, if included, which shall be put last. Each radio frequency channel shall then be assigned an ARFCN_INDEX value, ranging from zero, for the first radio frequency channel, to NF-1, for the last radio frequency channel.
EC Mobile Allocation List (construction)
This construction is the representation of the EC Mobile Allocation set(s) defined for the cell. An EC_MA_NUMBER field preceding the EC Mobile Allocation set identifies each individual EC Mobile Allocation set. The EC Mobile Allocation List may be provided in more than one instance of the EC SI 1 message.
EC_MA_NUMBER (5 bits)
This field identifies the EC Mobile Allocation set provided in the EC Mobile Allocation List struct. It is coded as follows:
Bits
5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0 0 	EC Mobile Allocation set 1
0 0 0 0 1 	EC Mobile Allocation set 2
…
1 1 1 1 1 	EC Mobile Allocation set 32
MAIO (6 bits)
This field is the binary representation of the mobile allocation index offset (MAIO), see 3GPP TS 45.002.
ARFCN (10 bits)
This field is the binary representation of the absolute radio frequency channel number (ARFCN) defined in 3GPP TS 45.005.
HSN (6 bits)
The HSN field is the binary representation of the hopping sequence number, see 3GPP TS 45.002.
MA_LENGTH (6 bits)
This field indicates the length of the MA_BITMAP field in number of bits.
It is coded as follows:

General rules for handling of the neighbour cell reselection parameter default values are as follows:
If the first set of cell reselection parameters in the EC Neighbour Cell Reselection Parameters struct does not include all the cell reselection parameters, the following default values shall be applied:
	Field name	Default value

	CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET : 	C2=C1, see 3GPP TS 45.008
In the absence of any neighbour cell reselection parameter for any given BCCH carrier, the cell reselection parameter value of the previous BCCH carrier shall apply. This principle also applies when going from EC SI 3 instance i over to EC SI 3 instance i+1.
Nb_NCELL (5 bits)
This field indicates the number of neighbour BCCH carriers for which cell reselection parameters are provided. The value of the Nb_NCELL field shall equal the number of BCCH carriers (NF) included in the Neighbour Frequency List Information field.

The BA_IND is needed to allow the network to discriminate measurements results related to different GSM Neighbour Cell lists sent to the MS, as described in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1. The value of this parameter is reflected in the ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message and in the MEASUREMENT REPORT message.
3G_BA_IND (1 bit), 3G Sequence Number.
The 3G_BA_IND is needed to indicate new sets of 3G Neighbour Cell information or E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell information, as described in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1. The value received is reflected in the MEASUREMENT REPORT and ENHANCED MEASUREMENT REPORT message.

This parameter is used to indicate the MS a change of information concerning REPORT PRIORITY, MEASUREMENT INFORMATION, 3G MEASUREMENT INFORMATION and 3G Measurement Control Parameters, as described in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1,.
MI_INDEX (4 bits) and MI_COUNT (4 bits)
The purpose of the MI_INDEX and MI_COUNT fields is to indicate the number of individual messages within the sequence of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages and to assign an index to identify each of them. The MI_INDEX field is binary coded, range 0 to 15, and provides an index to identify the individual MEASUREMENT INFORMATION message. The MI_COUNT field is binary coded, range 0 to 15, and provides the MI_INDEX value for the last (highest indexed) message in the sequence of MEASUREMENT INFORMATION messages.

Table 9.1.60.2: EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message details
Message Type (4 bit field)
This field indicates the type of  message sent on the EC-CCCH (see Table 10.4.4)

Used DL Coverage Class (2 bit field)

Control messages on the EC-AGCH or EC-PCH are sent using blind physical layer transmissions, depending on the assigned downlink coverage class for the mobile station that the message is being sent to. The Used DL Coverage Class field is included in order to inform other mobile stations about the downlink coverage class, and thus the number of blind physical layer transmissions, that have been used to transmit the current control message. Mobile stations that have selected a lower downlink coverage class than what is indicated by this field can, upon successfully reading the control message, can avoid monitoring any remaining blind physical layer transmissions used to send the control message. This field is coded as follows:
bit
2 1
0 0		DL CC 1
0 1		DL CC 2
1 0		DL CC 3
1 1		DL CC 4

EC Page Extension (4 bit field)
This field indicates whether an EC capable mobile station of a specific coverage class should attempt one additional instance of page reading on the EC-PCH (see sub-clause 3.5.1a) when it successfully reads a message when waking up according to its nominal paging group but does not  receive a matching page. This field is coded as follows:
bit
4  3  2  1
1 X X X	mobile stations using downlink CC1shall attempt one additional page reading
X 1 X X	mobile stations using downlink CC2 shall attempt one additional page reading
X X 1 X	mobile stations using downlink CC3 shall attempt one additional page reading
X X X 1	mobile stations using downlink CC4 shall attempt one additional page reading

EC Request Reference (13 bit field)

This field is coded as described in sub-clause 10.5.2.83

EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 (15 bit field)

This information element is coded as described in sub-clause 10.5.2.85

Enhanced Access Burst  (1 bit field)

This field indicates whether or not the mobile station shall use the Enhanced Access Burst procedure for contention resolution (see 3GPP TS 44.060) on the assigned EC TBF. This field is coded as follows:

Bit
0-	The Enhanced Access Burst procedure shall not be used
1-	The Enhanced Access Burst procedure shall be used

Timing Advance (6 bit field) 

This field provides the timing advance value and is coded as per the value part of the Timing Advance IE described in sub-clause 10.5.2.40, with the value range limited to 0 to 63. If this field is not included the mobile station shall use a default value of 0 (i.e. no timing advance).

STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT (3 bit field) 

This field indicates the first assigned timeslot within the set of assigned uplink timeslots.:

Bit
3 2 1
0 0 0		Timeslot 0 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
0 0 1 	Timeslot 1 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
0 1 0		Timeslot 2 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
0 1 1		Timeslot 3 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
1 0 0		Timeslot 4 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
1 0 1		Timeslot 5 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
1 1 0		Timeslot 6 is the first assigned uplink timeslot
1 1 1		Timeslot 7 is the first assigned uplink timeslot

A mobile station assigned CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the uplink is always assigned the use of 4 consecutive timeslots and therefore only timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 shall be indicated as the first assigned uplink timeslot.
 
Uplink_TFI_Assignment (5 bit field) 

This field is the binary representation of the Temporary Flow Identity, see 3GPP TS 44.060. Range: 0 to 31.

STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET (2 bit field)

This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the assignment that is used for transfer of downlink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the UL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the downlink assignment depends on the assigned DL Coverage Class. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded as an offset to the timeslot assigned with the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS fields in the same message.
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the same timeslots are assigned in both the uplink and the downlink directions. The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following:
bit
2 1
0 0       Same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT – 3
If UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1 and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following:
bit
2 1
0 0       Same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 1
1 0       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 2
1 1       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT + 3
If both UL_COVERAGE_CLASS and DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the downlink is assigned to the timeslot indicated by the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT field. If timer T3248 (sent in EC SI) is used, the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field defines the lowest assigned timeslot for EC-PACCH transfers using CC2 while timer T3248 is running (see 3GPP TS 44.060). The STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is then encoded according to the following:
bit
2 1
0 0       Same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT
0 1       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0       STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1       No valid CC2 mapping applies while T3248 is running, CC1 to be used 

A mobile station using CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the downlink is always assigned the use of 4 consecutive timeslots.

OVERLAID_CDMA_CODE (2 bit field) 

This field indicates the type overload CDMA code to be used for an uplink TBF (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]). This field is coded as follows:

bit
2 1
0 0       Overlaid CDMA Code 0
0 1       Overlaid CDMA Code 1
1 0       Overlaid CDMA Code 2
1 1       Overlaid CDMA Code 3 

Note: Overlaid CDMA Code 0 corresponds to that the bursts are transmitted as if no code was applied.
Assigned MCS (4 bit field) 

This field is coded as per EGPRS Modulation and Coding Scheme IE decribed in 3GPP TS 44.060.

GAMMA (5 bit field)

This field is the binary representation of the parameter CH for MS output power control in units of 2 dB, see 3GPP TS 45.008.

ALPHA Enable (1 bit field)

This field indicates whether or not the mobile station shall use the ALPHA parameter (if sent as part of EC SI) for uplink power control (see 3GPP TS 45.008 [34]). This field is coded as follows:

0		  Do not use the ALPHA parameter 
1		  Use the ALPHA parameter

P0 (4 bit field) 

For description and encoding, see the Packet Uplink Assignment message in 3GPP TS 44.060.

PR_MODE (1 bit field)

For description and encoding, see the Packet Uplink Assignment message in 3GPP TS 44.060.

Start_First_UL_Data_Block (4 bit field) 
This field identifies the uplink transmission opportunity corresponding to the assigned uplink coverage class (see the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 IE described in sub-clause 10.5.2.85) that the mobile station is to use to start sending its first uplink RLC data block on the set of assigned uplink timeslots. The 1st transmission opportunity occurs no earlier than in TDMA frame N+10 where TDMA frame N is the last TDMA frame used for transmission of the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 or EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 2 message. See 3GPP TS 45.010 [35] for mobile station reaction time requirements applicable to receiving an assignment message. This field is coded as follows:

Bit
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0		  Use the 1st transmission opportunity
0 0 0 1		  Use the 2nd transmission opportunity
0 0 1 0		  Use the 3rd transmission opportunity
.
.
.
1 1 1 1		  Use the 16th transmission opportunity

For CC1 the Kth transmission opportunity = the Kth BTTI radio block on the assigned timeslot occurring after TDMA frame N+9. The Kth BTTI radio block occurs in one of {B0, B1, …B11} (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]), whichever occurs first after TDMA frame N+9.

For CC2 the Kth transmission opportunity = the Kth set of 4 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring after TDMA frame N+9. The Kth set of 4 BTTI radio blocks occurs in one of {B0, B1, …B11}, whichever occurs first after TDMA frame N+9.

For CC3 the Kth transmission opportunity = the Kth set of 8 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring after TDMA frame N+9. The Kth set of 8 BTTI radio blocks occurs in one of {[B0, B1], [B2, B3],  …[B10, B11]}, whichever occurs first after TDMA frame N+9.
 
For CC4 the Kth transmission opportunity = the Kth set of 16 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring after TDMA frame N+9. The Kth set of 16 BTTI radio blocks occurs in one of {[B0, B1, B2, B3], [B4, B5, B6, B7], [B8, B9, B10, B11]}, whichever occurs first after TDMA frame N+9.


Start_FN_Next_Data_Block (3 bit field)

This field identifies the gap (in coverage class specific transmission opportunities) between the last pre-allocated uplink radio block transmitted on assigned uplink timeslots and the next pre-allocated uplink radio block to be used for the uplink transmission. This field is coded as follows:

Bit
3 2 1
0 0 0	  a gap of 1 transmission opportunity
0 0 1	  a gap of 2 transmission opportunities
0 1 0	  a gap of 3 transmission opportunities
.
.
.
1 1 1	  a gap of 8 transmission opportunities

For CC1 a gap of K transmission opportunities = K BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslot occurring immediately after the last BTTI radio block used for the uplink transmission. Any BTTI radio block in the set of {B0, B1, …B11} counts as a gap of one CC1 transmission opportunity (see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]).

For CC2 a gap of K transmission opportunities = K sets of 4 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring immediately after the last set of 4 BTTI radio block used for the uplink transmission. Each set of 4 BTTI radio blocks occurring in one of {B0, B1, …B11} counts as a gap of one CC2 transmission opportunity.

For CC3 a gap of K transmission opportunities = K sets of 8 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring immediately after the last set of 8 BTTI radio block used for the uplink transmission. Each set of 8 BTTI radio blocks occurring in one of {[B0, B1], [B2, B3],…[B10, B11]} counts as a gap of one CC3 transmission opportunity.

For CC4 a gap of K transmission opportunities = K sets of 16 BTTI radio blocks on the assigned timeslots occurring immediately after the last set of 16 BTTI radio block used for the uplink transmission. Each set of 16 BTTI radio blocks occurring in one of {[B0, B1, B2, B3], [B4, B5, B6, B7], [B8, B9, B10, B11]} counts as a gap of one CC4 transmission opportunity.

STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT (3 bit field) 

This field indicates the first assigned timeslot within the set of assigned downlink timeslots.:

Bit
3 2 1
0 0 0		Timeslot 0 is the first assigned downlink timeslot
0 0 1 	Timeslot 1 is the first assigned downlink timeslot

1 0 1		Timeslot 5 is the first assigned downlink timeslot
1 1 0		Timeslot 6 is the first assigned downlink timeslot
1 1 1		Timeslot 7 is the first assigned downlink timeslot


A mobile station using CC2, CC3 or CC4 on the downlink is always assigned 4 consecutive timeslots and therefore only timeslot 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 shall be indicated as the first assigned downlink timeslot.

Downlink_TFI_Assignment (5 bit field) 

This field is the binary representation of the Temporary Flow Identity, see 3GPP TS 44.060. Range: 0 to 31.

TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR (2 bit field)
This field defines how many downlink timeslots the assignment contains when the assigned downlink Coverage Class is CC1. The field is coded as follows:
bit
2 1
0 0	1 timeslot assigned 
0 1	2 timeslots assigned
1 0	3 timeslots assigned
1 1	4 timeslots assigned

Values other than ‘00’ can only be used if supported by the mobile station, as indicated by its multislot capability, see 3GPP TS 45.002 [32]. If the assigned downlink Coverage Class > CC1 (see the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 field), the mobile station shall consider the TIMESLOT_MULTIPLICATOR field as invalid.

STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET (2 bit field)
This field defines the timeslot number of the lowest timeslot included in the assignment that is used for transfer of uplink RLC/MAC control messages on the EC-PACCH during the DL EC TBF. The number of additional timeslots that are included in the uplink assignment depends on the assigned UL Coverage Class. The assigned timeslots are contiguous, starting with the timeslot number indicated in the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field. The STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded as an offset to the timeslot assigned with the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT field. The encoding of the field is dependent of the value of the DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS fields in the same message.
If both DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the same timeslots are assigned in both the uplink and the downlink directions. The STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field can then be considered as not valid by the mobile station.
If DL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1, the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following:
bit
2 1
0 0       Same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT
0 1       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 1
1 0       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 2
1 1       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT - 3
If DL_COVERAGE_CLASS > CC1 and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1, the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is encoded according to the following:
bit
2 1
0 0       Same timeslot as indicated by STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT
0 1       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 1
1 0       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 2
1 1       STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT + 3
If both DL_COVERAGE_CLASS and UL_COVERAGE_CLASS = CC1 (indicated by the EC Packet Channel Description Type 2 IE - see sub-clause 10.5.2.85), the uplink EC-PACCH is assigned to the timeslot indicated by the STARTING_DL_TIMESLOT field. In this case the STARTING_UL_TIMESLOT_OFFSET field is considered as invalid by the mobile station. 
GAMMA (5 bit field) 

This field is the binary representation of the parameter CH for MS output power control in units of 2 dB, see 3GPP TS 45.008.

ALPHA Enable (1 bit field)

This field indicates the priority of the uplink data transfer being requested by the mobile station as follows:
0	normal priority (normal report)
1	high priority (exception report)
Selected DL Coverage Class (3 bit field)

This field indicates the Downlink Coverage Class that the mobile station has determined to be applicable at the point of sending an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST and, when CC1 applies to the downlink, the extent to which the C-value exceeds the value indicated by the BT_Threshold_DL parameter sent in EC SI2 (see sub-clause 9.1.43q):
Case 1: EC SYSTEM INFORMATION indicates 4 of 4 possible coverage classes are supported:
bit
3 2 1
0 0 0		DL CC4
0 0 1		DL CC3
0 1 0		DL CC2
0 1 1		DL CC1; BT_Threshold_DL ≤ C_VALUE < BT_Threshold_DL + X dB

10	General message format and information elements coding
The figures and text in this sub-clause describe the Information Elements contents.
10.1	Overview
Within the RR protocols defined in 3GPP TS 44.018, every message with the exception of the messages sent on the BCCH, downlink CCCH, SCH, EC-SCH, RACH and the HANDOVER ACCESS message, is a standard L3 message as defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. This means that the message consists of the following parts:
a)	protocol discriminator;
b)	skip indicator;
c)	message type;
d)	other information elements, as required.
This organization is illustrated in the example shown in figure 10.1.1.

Figure 10.1.1: General message organization example
Messages sent on the EC-AGCH are formatted as described in sub-clause 9.1.30c. Messages sent on the EC-BCCH and EC-CCCH use a short message type as described in sub-clause 10.4. All messagessent on the EC-CCCH consist of the following fields in the order listed:
-	Message Type field (4 bits)
-	Used DL Coverage Class (2 bits)
-	EC Page Extension (5 bits, except for the EC Dummy message in which case this field is excluded)
-	Additional fields (message specific)
A mobile station that has enabled EC operation and receives an RR message on downlink EC-CCCH with a message type it does not understand shall still read the Used DL Coverage Class and EC Page Extension fields while ignoring the remaining part of the message. 
Unless specified otherwise in the message descriptions of sub-clause 9, a particular information element shall not be present more than once in a given message.
The term "default" implies that the value defined shall be used in the absence of any assignment, or that this value allows negotiation of alternative values in between the two peer entities.
When a field extends over more than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet number increases. The least significant bit of the field is represented by the lowest numbered bit of the highest numbered octet of the field.
When a message is coded using CSN.1 notation, the definition of the CSN.1 syntax in CSN.1 Specification, Version 2.0, shall be used.
10.2	Protocol Discriminator
The Protocol Discriminator (PD) and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.
10.3	Skip indicator
10.3.1	Skip indicator
Bits 5 to 8 of the first octet of every Radio Resource management message and GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message contain the skip indicator. 
When network sharing is in use in a cell, and in the case of the PAGING RESPONSE message, a mobile station supporting network sharing shall encode the skip indicator as described within 3GPP TS 24.008. A supporting network receiving a PAGING RESPONSE message with a skip indicator different from ‘0000’ shall consider the mobile station as supporting network sharing. 
When network sharing is in use in a cell, and in the case of the GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message, a mobile station supporting network sharing may encode the skip indicator different from ‘0000’ (see sub-clause 3.4.26) coded as described within 3GPP TS 24.008. 
For all other cases, a message received with skip indicator different from ‘0000’ shall be ignored. A message received with skip indicator encoded as ‘0000’ shall not be ignored (unless it is ignored for other reasons). A protocol entity sending a Radio Resource management message or GPRS Transparent Transport protocol message shall encode the skip indicator as ‘0000’.
10.4	Message Type
The message type IE and its use are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007. Tables 10.4.1 and 10.4.2 define the value part of the message type IE used in the Radio Resource management protocol. Table 10.4.3 defines the value part of the message type IE used in the GPRS Transparent Transport protocol. Table 10.4.4 defines the value part of the message type IE used in the Radio Resource management protocol for messages sent on the EC-BCCH and EC-CCCH.

10.5	Other information elements
The different formats (V, LV, T, TV, TLV) and the four categories of information elements (type 1, 2, 3, and 4) are defined in 3GPP TS 24.007.
The first octet of an information element in the non-imperative part contains the IEI of the information element. If this octet does not correspond to an IEI known in the message, the receiver shall determine whether this IE is of type 1 or 2 (i.e. it is an information element of one octet length) or an IE of type 4 (i.e. that the next octet is the length indicator indicating the length of the remaining of the information element) (see 3GPP TS 24.007).
This allows the receiver to jump over unknown information elements and to analyse any following information elements.
The information elements which are common for at least two of the three protocols Radio Resources management, Mobility Management and Call Control, are listed in 3GPP TS 24.008.
The information elements for the protocols Radio Resources management are listed in sub-clause 10.5.2. Default information element identifiers are listed in annex K.
NOTE:	Different information elements may have the same default information element identifier if they belong to different protocols.
The descriptions of the information element types in sub-clause 10.5.2 are organized in alphabetical order of the IE types. Each IE type is described in one sub-clause.
The sub-clause may have an introduction:
-	possibly explaining the purpose of the IE;
-	possibly describing whether the IE belongs to type 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5;
-	possibly indicating the length that the information element has if it is either type 5 or if it is used in format TV (type 1 and 3) or TLV (type 4).
A figure of the sub-clause defines the structure of the IE indicating:
-	possibly the position and length of the IEI. (However it depends on the message in which the IE occurs whether the IE contains an IEI.);
-	the fields the IE value part is composed of;
-	possibly the position and length of the length indicator. (However it depends on the IE type whether the IE contains a length indicator or not.);
-	possibly octet numbers of the octets that compose the IE (see sub-clause a) below).
Finally, the sub-clause contains tables defining the structure and value range of the fields that compose the IE value part. The order of appearance for information elements in a message is defined in clause 9.
The order of the information elements within the imperative part of messages has been chosen so that information elements with 1/2 octet of content (type 1) go together in succession. The first type 1 information element occupies bits 1 to 4 of octet N, the second bits 5 to 8 of octet N, the third bits 1 to 4 of octet N + 1 etc. If the number of type 1 information elements is odd then bits 5 to 8 of the last octet occupied by these information elements contains a spare half octet IE in format V.
Where the description of information elements in this Technical Specification contains bits defined to be "spare bits", these bits shall set to the indicated value (0 or 1) by the sending side, and their value shall be ignored by the receiving side. With few exceptions, spare bits are indicated as being set to "0" in 3GPP TS 44.018.
The following rules apply for the coding of type 4 information elements:
a)	The octet number of an octet (which is defined in the figure of a sub-clause) consists of a positive integer, possibly of an additional letter, and possibly of an additional asterisk, see sub-clause f). The positive integer identifies one octet or a group of octets.
b)	Each octet group is a self contained entity. The internal structure of an octet group may be defined in alternative ways.
c)	An octet group is formed by using some extension mechanism. The preferred extension mechanism is to extend an octet (N) through the next octet(s) (Na, Nb, etc.) by using bit 8 in each octet as an extension bit.
	The bit value "0" indicates that the octet group continues through to the next octet. The bit value "1" indicates that this octet is the last octet of the group. If one octet (Nb) is present, the preceding octets (N and Na) shall also be present.
	In the format descriptions appearing in sub-clause 10.5.1 to 10.5.4, bit 8 is marked "0/1 ext" if another octet follows. Bit 8 is marked "1 ext" if this is the last octet in the extension domain.
	Additional octets may be defined in later versions of the protocols ("1 ext" changed to "0/1 ext") and equipments shall be prepared to receive such additional octets; the contents of these octets shall be ignored. However the length indicated in clauses 9 and 10 only takes into account this version of the protocols.
d)	In addition to the extension mechanism defined above, an octet (N) may be extended through the next octet(s) (N+1, N+2 etc.) by indications in bits 7-1 (of octet N).
e)	The mechanisms in c) and d) may be combined.
f)	Optional octets are marked with asterisks (*).

Number of Ranges parameter
The number of Ranges parameter indicates in binary the number of ranges to be transmitted in the IE. It shall have a minimum value of 1.
RANGEi_LOWER	
If $(impr-BA-range-handling)$ is not supported:
$begin
The RANGEi_LOWER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the lower limit of a range of frequencies to be used by the mobile station in cell selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022)
$end
If $(impr-BA-range-handling)$ is supported:
$begin
The RANGEi_LOWER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the lower limit of a range of frequencies which could be used by the mobile station in cell selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022)
$end
RANGEi_HIGHER
If $(impr-BA-range-handling)$ is not supported:
$begin
The RANGEi_HIGHER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the higher limit of a range of frequencies to be used by the mobile station in cell selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022)
$end
If $(impr-BA-range-handling)$ is supported:
$begin
The RANGEi HIGHER is coded as the binary representation of the ARFCN used as the higher limit of a range of frequencies which could be used by the mobile station in cell selection (see 3GPP TS 45.008 and 3GPP TS 23.022)
$end
If the length of the BA range information element is greater than the number of octets required to carry the Number of Ranges given in octet 3, then any unused octets or parts of octets at the end of the IE shall be considered as spare.
If $(impr-BA-range-handling)$ is supported:
If a mobile station receives range information which has ranges or part of the ranges which are not supported by the mobile station, the mobile station shall take into account those parts of the ranges which it does support.

10.5.2.1b	Cell Channel Description
The purpose of the Cell Channel Description information element is to provide the reference frequency list to be used to decode the mobile allocation information element.
The Cell Channel Description is a type 3 information element with 17 octets length.
There are several formats for the Cell Channel Description information element, distinguished by the "format indicator" subfield. Some formats are frequency bit maps, the others use a special encoding scheme.
NOTE:	No more than 64 RF channels should be encoded in the Cell Allocation since this is the maximum number of RF channels which can be referenced in the Mobile Allocation IE.
10.5.2.1b.1	General description
Figure 10.5.2.1b.1.1 shows only a special bit numbering. The different general format is described in table 10.5.2.1b.1.1.

10.5.2.1c	BA List Pref
The purpose of the BA List Pref information element is to provide the mobile station with ARFCN information which can be used in the cell selection/reselection procedure.
The BA List Pref is a type 4 information element with a minimum length of 3 octets. No upper length limit is specified except for that given by the maximum number of octets in a L3 message (see 3GPP TS 44.006).
< BA List Pref >::=

	< spare padding >;
< RANGE LIMITS >::=

The value 0 indicates that the increment value is 15 but the concerned channel is not used and the next field, i.e. Increment skip ARFCN n+1 (if present) must be added to the increment to determine the next absolute RF channel number in the sequence of channels used in the frequency hopping.


10.5.2.13	Frequency List
The purpose of the Frequency List information element is to provide the list of the absolute radio frequency channel numbers used in a frequency hopping sequence.
The Frequency List information element is a type 4 information element.
There are several formats for the Frequency List information element, distinguished by the "format indicator" subfield. Some formats are frequency bit maps, the others use a special encoding scheme.
10.5.2.13.1	General description
Table 10.5.2.13.1.1: Frequency List information element, general format
FORMAT-ID, Format Identifier (part of octet 3)

The different formats are distinguished by the FORMAT-ID field. The possible values are the following:

Bit	Bit	Bit	Bit	Bit	format notation
8	7	4	3	2

0	0	X	X	X	bit map 0
1	0	0	X	X	1024 range
1	0	1	0	0	512 range
1	0	1	0	1	256 range
1	0	1	1	0	128 range
1	0	1	1	1	variable bit map
All other combinations are reserved for future use.

A GSM 900 mobile station which only supports the primary GSM band P-GSM 900 (cf. 3GPP TS 45.005) may consider all values except the value for bit map 0 as reserved.

The significance of the remaining bits depends on the FORMAT-ID. The different cases are specified in the next sub-clauses.

INDEX := K;

	N := W(INDEX);
	while INDEX>1 loop
		if 2*INDEX < 3*J then									-- left child
			INDEX := INDEX - J/2;
			N := (N + W(INDEX) + 128/J - 2) mod (256/J - 1) + 1;
		else													-- right child
			INDEX := INDEX - J;
			N := (N + W(INDEX) + 256/J - 2) mod (256/J - 1) + 1;
		end if;
		J := J/2;
	end loop;
	F(K) := (W(0) + N) mod 1024;

NCELL Report
The NCELL Report IE provides neighbour cell measurement reports for GSM cells, UTRAN cells or E-UTRAN cells.
RXLEV-NCELL i (6 bit field)
Result of measurement on the i'th neighbour cell
If the i'th neighbour cell is a GSM cell, the RXLEV-NCELL field is coded as the binary representation of a value N. N corresponds according to the mapping defined in 3GPP TS 45.008 to the received signal strength on the i'th neighbouring cell.
If the i'th neighbour cell is a 3G cell, the contents of the RXLEV-NCELL field is defined in 3GPP TS 45.008.
Range: 0 to 63.
BCCH_FREQ_NCELL (5 bit field)
The content of this field depends on whether the report is on a GSM cell, UTRAN cell or E-UTRAN cell, as described below.
BSIC_NCELL (6 bit field)
The content of this field depends on whether the report is on a GSM cell, UTRAN cell or E-UTRAN cell, as described below.
Report on GSM cells:
BCCH-FREQ-NCELL i, BCCH carrier of the i'th neighbour cell.
The BCCH-FREQ-NCELL i field is coded as the binary representation of the position, starting with 0, of the i'th neighbour cells BCCH carrier in the BCCH channel list. The BCCH channel list is composed of one or two BCCH channel sub lists, each sub list is derived from the set of frequencies defined by reference neighbour cell description information element or elements. In the latter case the set is the union of the two sets defined by the two neighbour cell description information elements.
In each BCCH channel sub list the absolute RF channel numbers are placed in increasing order of ARFCN, except that ARFCN 0, if included in the set, is put in the last position in the sub list. The BCCH channel list consists either of only the sub list derived from the neighbour cell description information element(s) in System Information 2/5 (and possible 2bis/5bis) or of that sub list immediately followed by the sub list derived from the neighbour cell description information element in System Information 2ter/5ter for the case System Information 2ter/5ter is also received. If the set of ARFCNs defined by the reference neighbour cell description information element or elements includes frequencies that the mobile station does not support then these ARFCNs shall be included in the list.
The notation 2/5 etc. means that the rules above apply to the neighbour cell description information elements received in System Information 2, 2bis and 2ter and to those received in System Information 5, 5bis and 5ter separately.
Range: 0 to 31/30.
Report on 3G cells:
If no more than 31 (GSM) ARFCN frequencies are included in the BA (list), the index BCCH-FREQ-NCELL 31 indicates report(s) on 3G cells.
In this case, the corresponding 'BSIC-NCELL' field in figure 10.5.2.20.1 carries the index of the i'th 3G neighbour cell in the 3G Neighbour Cell list defined in sub-clause 3.4.1.2.1.1, "Deriving the 3G Neighbour Cell list from the 3G Neighbour Cell Description". 3G cells with indexes above 63 are not reported (6 bits field).
If more than 31 (GSM) ARFCN frequencies are included in the BA (list), reporting of 3G cells is not possible with this IE.
Range: 0 to 63.
Report on E-UTRAN cells:
If no more than (31 - NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES) GSM ARFCN frequencies are included in the BA (list), the BCCH-FREQ-NCELL indices from (31 - NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES) to 30 (inclusive) indicate report(s) on E-UTRAN cells. The index BCCH-FREQ-NCELL 30 indicates a report of an E-UTRAN neighbour cell on the first frequency defined in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list, the value 29 indicates a report of an E-UTRAN neighbour cell on the second frequency in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list and so on.
NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES is defined as the number of separate E-UTRAN frequencies in the E-UTRAN Neighbour Cell list. 
If the BCCH-FREQ-NCELL index indicates an E-UTRAN frequency, the corresponding 'BSIC-NCELL' field in figure 10.5.2.20.1 contains the least significant 6 bits of the physical layer cell identity (see 3GPP TS 36.211) of the E-UTRAN neighbour cell. The corresponding ‘RXLEV-NCELL’ field in figure 10.5.2.20.1 contains the 3 bit measurement value (see  3GPP TS 45.008) in the most significant 3 bits of the field and the most significant 3 bits of the physical layer cell identity in the least significant 3 bits of the field. 
If more than (31 - NUM_E-UTRAN_FREQUENCIES) GSM ARFCN frequencies are included in the BA (list), reporting of E-UTRAN cells is not possible with this IE.
BSIC-NCELL i (6 bit field)
Base station identity code of the i'th neighbour cell
For GSM cells, the BSIC-NCELL i field is coded as the binary representation of the base station identity code of the i'th neighbour cell.
Range: 0 to 63.
UTRAN CSG Measurement Report
This information element contains the measurement report for a UTRAN CSG cell or detected hybrid cell. A UTRAN CSG cell or detected hybrid cell is identified by the Cell Identity and optionally the PLMN-ID.
This information element is defined as the UTRAN CSG Measurement Report IE described in 3GPP TS 44.060.

10.5.2.20a	(void)
10.5.2.21	Mobile Allocation

MA C i, Mobile allocation RF channel i (octet 3 etc.), i = 1, 2,..., NF
The MA C i bit indicates whether or not the Mobile allocation frequency list includes the i'th frequency in the cell allocation frequency list.
The cell allocation frequency list is derived from the set of frequencies defined by the reference cell channel description information element. NF denotes the number of frequencies in the cell allocation frequency list.
In the cell allocation frequency list the absolute RF channel numbers are placed in increasing order of ARFCN, except that ARFCN 0, if included in the set, is put in the last position in the list,

For a RF channel belonging to the mobile allocation the MA C i bit is coded with a "1"; i = 1, 2,..., NF.

For a RF channel not belonging to the mobile allocation the MA C i bit is coded with a "0"; i = 1, 2,..., NF.

If NF mod 8 <> 0 then bits NF to 8n in octet 3 must be coded with a "0" in each.

EXT-IND, Extension indication (octet 2, bit 6)

If received in System Information 2, 2bis, 5 or 5bis this bit indicates whether the information element carries the complete information of a BCCH channel sub list or whether a complementary information element is sent in another message.
A GSM 900 mobile station which only supports the primary GSM band P‑GSM 900 (cf. 3GPP TS 45.005) may consider this bit as a spare bit and assume that the information element carries the complete BA, see sub-clause 3.2.2.1.

NOTE 1: EXT-IND is set to 1 in the neighbour cell description information elements in System Information 2 and 2bis and 5 and 5bis respectively when more than one is needed to describe a BCCH channel sub list.

Bit 6

0	The information element carries the complete BA

1	The information element carries only a part of the BA

BA-IND, BCCH allocation sequence number indication (octet 2). Range 0 to 1

The BA-IND is needed to allow the network to discriminate measurements results related to different BAs (e.g. BA(BCCH) and BA(SACCH)) sent to the
MS.

NOTE 2: The network should change the contents of the Neighbour Cell Description information element (FORMAT-ID and/or set of ARFCNs) when changing the ciphering mode from not ciphered to ciphered with algorithm A5/1 (see sub-clause 3.4.7.2). For this purpose, the network may change the set of frequencies, by including ARFCNs not in a frequency band supported by the MS, without changing the BA-IND value, provided the position in the resulting BA(SACCH) of the ARFCNs that are candidates for measurement reporting is not altered.
The network should also ensure that different mobiles in the cell receive different sets of ARFCNs when sent encrypted with A5/

10.5.2.22a	Neighbour Cell Description 2
The purpose of the Neighbour Cell Description 2 information element is to provide the absolute radio frequency channel numbers of the BCCH carriers to be monitored by the mobile stations in the cell.

NOTE: The network should change the contents of the Neighbour Cell Description 2 information element (FORMAT-ID and/or set of ARFCNs) when changing the ciphering mode from not ciphered to ciphered with algorithm A5/1 (see sub-clause 3.4.7.2). For this purpose, the network may change the set of frequencies, by including ARFCNs not in a frequency band supported by the MS, without changing the BA-IND value, provided the position in the resulting BA(SACCH) of the ARFCNs that are candidates for measurement reporting is not altered.
The network should also ensure that different mobiles in the cell receive different sets of ARFCNs when sent encrypted with A5/1.

RA, Random Access Information (octet 2)
This is an unformatted 8 bit field. Typically the contents of this field are coded the same as the CHANNEL REQUEST message shown in Figure 9.1.8.1 and Table 9.1.8.1, sub-clause 9.1.8. When included in an EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message (see sub-claue 9.1.59) this field is coded as the 8 least significant bits of the corresponding EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message sent on the RACH (see sub-claue 9.1.65) and is never used to indicate the presence of Extended RA information. The 8 least significant bits of an EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message are identified using the same method for identifying the 5 least significant of an EGPRS PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message described in sub-clause 10.5.2.16 for the case where the Extended RA field is included in the IA Rest Octets information element (i.e. when the Request Reference IE is included in the EC IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENT TYPE 1 message the RA field shall include all fields of the EC PACKET CHANNEL REQUEST message except for the ‘EC-NumberOfBlocks’ field).
T1' (octet 3)
The T1' field is coded as the binary representation of (FN div 1326) mod 32.
T3 (octet 3 and 4)
The T3 field is coded as the binary representation of FN mod 51. Bit 3 of octet 3 is the most significant bit and bit 6 of octet 4 is the least significant bit.
T2 (octet 4)
The T2 field is coded as the binary representation of FN mod 26.
NOTE 1:	The frame number, FN modulo 42432 can be calculated as 51x((T3-T2) mod 26)+T3+51x26xT1'

10.5.2.30a	Random Reference/ Establishment Cause
The purpose of the Random Reference/ Establishment Cause information element within Priority Uplink Request is to provide the reason for the request and a random reference to correlate a VGCS UPLINK GRANT with the PRIORITY UPLINK REQUEST message sent by a mobile station. It is based on the UPLINK ACCESS message (subclause 9.1.45).
The Random Reference/ Establishment Cause is coded as shown in figure 10.5.2.30a.1 and table 10.5.2.30a.1
The Random Reference/Establishment Cause is a type 3 information element with 1 octet length.

If the first neighbour cell defined in SI2n with SI2n_INDEX = 0 does not include all the parameter values, the following default values shall be used: 
	RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN : 						Serving cell RXLEV_ACCESS_MIN
	MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH : 					Serving cell MS_TXPWR_MAX_CCH
	CBQ : 												0
	CELL_RESELECT_OFFSET, 
	TEMPORARY_OFFSET, and
	PENALTY_TIME : 								C2=C1, see 3GPP TS 45.008

	POWER_OFFSET								0 dB
	CELL_BAR_ACCESS : 						Serving cell CELL_BAR_ACCESS
	SAME_LA_AS_SERVING_CELL : 			1 	(The cell is in the same Location Area as the serving cell)

T1' (octet 2)
The T1' field is coded as the binary representation of (FN div 1326) mod 32.

T3 (octet 2 and 3)
The T3 field is coded as the binary representation of FN mod 51. Bit 3 of octet 2 is the most significant bit and bit 6 of octet 3 is the least significant bit.

T2 (octet 3)
The T2 field is coded as the binary representation of FN mod 26.

NOTE 1:	The frame number, FN modulo 42432 can be calculated as 51x((T3-T2) mod 26)+T3+51x26xT1'


The starting time and the times mentioned above are with reference to the frame numbering in the concerned cell. They are given in units of frames (around 4.615 ms).
The Starting Time IE can encode only an interval of time of 42 432 frames, that is to say around 195.8 seconds. To remove any ambiguity, the specification for a reception at time T is that the encoded interval is (T-10808, T+31623). In rigorous terms, if we note ST the starting time:
	if 0 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 31623, the indicated time is the next time when FN mod 42432 is equal to ST;
	if 32024 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 42431, the indicated time has already elapsed.
The reception time T is not specified here precisely. To allow room for various MS implementations, the limit between the two behaviours above may be anywhere within the interval defined by:
	31624 <= (ST-T) mod 42432 <= 32023.

Static and dynamic conditions:
1)	Information from the last received neighbour cell description in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter is necessary for the mobile station to interpret <neighbour information>. If <BA ind> is different from the last received BA IND value indicated in SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 5/5bis/5ter, <neighbour information> cannot be interpreted by the mobile station.
2)	If the correspondence between neighbour cell frequencies and sets of pairs (BSIC, cell information) cannot be established following the rules below, or if more than one set of such pairs corresponds to one neighbour cell frequency, the mobile station shall diagnose an imperative message part error.
Attributes, field contents:
1)	<cell info> defines a BSIC given by <bsic : bit(6)>. It also defines cell information. If <cell parameters> is contained in <cell info>, this cell information is the cell information given by <cell parameters>; if <cell parameters> is not contained in <cell info>, this cell information is empty.
2)	<differential cell info> defines a BSIC given by <bsic : bit(6)> or by <BCC : bit(3)>, see below. It also defines cell information. If <diff cell pars> is contained in <differential cell info>, this cell information is the cell information given by <diff cell pars>; if <diff cell pars> is not contained in <differential cell info>, this cell information is empty.
3)	<cell parameters> either indicates a barred cell (by presence of <cell barred>)or specifies cell information given by <further cell info>.
4)	Each occurrence of <diff cell pars> either indicates a barred cell (by presence of <cell barred>)or specifies cell information given by <further diff cell info>.
5)	<further cell info> specifies cell information given by its components:
-	<la different>;
-	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;
-	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;
-	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;
-	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;
-	<penalty time : bit(5)>;
as defined below.
6)	For each occurrence of <further diff cell info>, a cell information is defined. This information is given by <la different> and remaining cell information established as follows:
	The remaining cell information defined for the first occurrence of <further diff cell info> consists of the cell information given by its actual components plus the cell information specified by <further cell info> corresponding to its missing components.
	The remaining cell information defined for a later occurrence of <further diff cell info> consists of the cell information given by its actual components plus the remaining cell information corresponding to its missing components which is defined for the previous occurrence of <further diff cell info>.
	Here, the
"actual components" of an occurrence of <further diff cell info> denotes those parameters among:
-	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;
-	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;
-	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;
-	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;
-	<penalty time : bit(5)>;
which are present in that occurrence.
"missing components" of an occurrence of <differential cell info> denote those parameters among:
-	<ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>;
-	<rxlev access min : bit(6)>;
-	<cell reselect offset : bit(6)>;
-	<temporary offset : bit(3)>;
-	<penalty time : bit(5)>;
which are not present in that occurrence.
7)	Each occurrence of <bsic : bit(6)> specifies a BSIC by encoding its binary representation. <BCC : bit(3)> specifies a BCC by encoding its binary representation; it specifies the BSIC given by that BCC and the NCC of the BSIC specified by the previous occurrence of <BCC : bit(3)> or <bsic : bit(6)>. All occurrences of <bsic: bit(6)> and <BCC : bit(3)> establish a list of BSIC.
8)	<first frequency : bit(5)> is the 5 bit binary coding of an integer n with 0 <= n <= 31. It specifies a first frequency number n+1.
9)	<SI10 rest octets> defines a correspondence between neighbour cell frequencies and sets of pairs (BSIC, cell information) defining the parameters for cell re-selection of any corresponding neighbour cell with BCCH on that frequency and having that BSIC:
-	Let a(1),..., a(n) be the list of neighbour cell frequencies, in the order determined by the mobile station. Let i be the first frequency number specified by <first frequency : bit(5)> (see above).
-	The first BSIC and the cell information specified by <cell info> build a pair belonging to the set corresponding to a(i).
-	If an m-th occurrence of <info field> is present (where m >=2), having established the correspondence of the (m-1)-th BSIC to a neighbour frequency a(k), the m-th BSIC and following <differential cell info>:
-	belong to a(k), if <next frequency> is not present in the m-th occurrence of <info field>;
-	belong to a((smod(k+t)), if <next frequency> is present exactly t times in the m-th occurrence of <info field>.
-	Here, for an integer j, smod(j) := ((j-1) mod n) + 1.
10)	If <la different> contains a <cell reselect hysteresis: bit(3)>, this means that the cell is to be considered by the mobile station to belong to a different location area and that for the cell, the cell reselect hysteresis specified in <cell reselect hysteresis : bit(3)> applies. 
11)	If <la different> doesn't contain a <cell reselect hysteresis: bit(3)>, this means that the cell is to be considered by the mobile station to belong to the same location area.
12)	For <cell reselect hysteresis : bit(3)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.
13)	For <ms txpwr max cch : bit(5)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.
14)	For <rxlev access min : bit(6)> see sub-clause 10.5.2.4.
15)	For <cell reselect offset : bit(6)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.
16)	For <temporary offset : bit(3)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.
17)	For <penalty time : bit(5)>: see sub-clause 10.5.2.35.

This field is coded as follows:

Bit
2 1 
0 0   Quarter Hyperframe 0
0 1   Quarter Hyperframe 1
1 0   Quarter Hyperframe 2
1 1   Quarter Hyperframe 3

The DL_COVERAGE_CLASS field (2 bits) indicates the downlink coverage class the mobile station is to use on the assigned packet resources. This field is coded as follows:

Bit
2 1 
0 0   DL Coverage Class 1
0 1   DL Coverage Class 2
1 0   DL Coverage Class 3
1 1   DL Coverage Class 4

The UL_COVERAGE_CLASS field (2 bits) indicates the uplink coverage class the mobile station is to use on the assigned packet resources. This field is coded as follows:

Bit
2 1
0 0   UL Coverage Class 1
0 1   UL Coverage Class 2
1 0   UL Coverage Class 3
1 1   UL Coverage Class 4

The TSC Set field (1 bit) indicates the TSC set corresponding to the TSC value indicated by the TSC field. This field is used for the assigned uplink and downlink PS resources 

0   TSC set 1 
1   Indicates TSC set 2 for 8PSK modulation and TSC set 3 for GMSK modulation (which is identical to TSC set 3 used for the CS domain). 

The TSC field (3 bits) is the binary representation of the training sequence code as defined in 3GPP TS 45.002.
Range: 0 to 7.

The EC_MA_NUMBER field (5 bits) identifies an EC Mobile Allocation set provided by the EC SYSTEM INFORMATION TYPE 1 message  (see sub-clause 9.1.43p). This field is coded as follows:

Bit
5 4 3 2 1
0 0 0 0 0  EC Mobile Allocation set 1
0 0 0 0 1  EC Mobile Allocation set 2
0 0 0 1 0  EC Mobile Allocation set 3
