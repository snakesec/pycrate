3	Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
3.1	Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905 [1].
AM MRB: An MRB associated with at least an AM RLC bearer for PTP transmission.
BH RLC channel: An RLC channel between two nodes, which is used to transport backhaul packets.
Broadcast MRB: A radio bearer configured for MBS broadcast delivery.
CEIL: Mathematical function used to 'round up' i.e. to the nearest integer having a higher or equal value.
DAPS bearer: a bearer whose radio protocols are located in both the source gNB and the target gNB during DAPS handover to use both source gNB and target gNB resources.
Dedicated signalling: Signalling sent on DCCH logical channel between the network and a single UE.
Dormant BWP: The dormant BWP is one of downlink BWPs configured by the network via dedicated RRC signalling. In the dormant BWP, the UE stops monitoring PDCCH on/for the SCell, but continues performing CSI measurements, Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and beam management, if configured. For each serving cell other than the SpCell or PUCCH SCell, the network may configure one BWP as a dormant BWP.
Field: The individual contents of an information element are referred to as fields.
FLOOR: Mathematical function used to 'round down' i.e. to the nearest integer having a lower or equal value.
Frequency Selection Area ID: An identity used for broadcast MBS session to guide the frequency selection of the UE as defined in TS 23.247 [67].
Global cell identity: An identity to uniquely identifying an NR cell. It is consisted of cellIdentity and plmn-Identity of the first PLMN-Identity in plmn-IdentityList in SIB1.
Information element: A structural element containing single or multiple fields is referred as information element.
MBS Radio Bearer: A radio bearer that is configured for MBS delivery.
Multicast/Broadcast Service: A point-to-multipoint service as defined in TS 23.247 [67].
Multicast MRB: A radio bearer configured for MBS multicast delivery.
MUSIM gap: Period that the UE may use to perform MUSIM operations.
NCSG: Network controlled small gap as defined in TS 38.133 [14].
NPN-only Cell: A cell that is only available for normal service for NPNs' subscriber. An NPN-capable UE determines that a cell is NPN-only Cell by detecting that the cellReservedForOtherUse IE is set to true while the npn-IdentityInfoList IE is present in CellAccessRelatedInfo.
NR sidelink communication: AS functionality enabling at least V2X Communication as defined in TS 23.287 [55], and ProSe Communication (including ProSe UE-to-Network Relay and non-Relay communication) as defined in TS 23.304 [65] between two or more nearby UEs, using NR technology but not traversing any network node.
NR sidelink discovery: AS functionality enabling ProSe non-Relay Discovery and ProSe UE-to-Network Relay discovery for Proximity based Services as defined in TS 23.304 [65] between two or more nearby UEs, using NR technology but not traversing any network node.
PNI-NPN identity: an identifier of a PNI-NPN comprising of a PLMN ID and a CAG -ID combination.
Primary Cell: The MCG cell, operating on the primary frequency, in which the UE either performs the initial connection establishment procedure or initiates the connection re-establishment procedure.
PC5 Relay RLC channel: An RLC channel between L2 U2N Remote UE and L2 U2N Relay UE, which is used to transport packets over PC5 for L2 UE-to-Network relay.

4.2	Architecture
4.2.1	UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can further be characterised as follows:

4.2.2	Signalling radio bearers
"Signalling Radio Bearers" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs) that are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically, the following SRBs are defined:
-	SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
-	SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB2 is for NAS messages and for RRC messages which include logged measurement information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security activation;
-	SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all using DCCH logical channel;
-	SRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement report information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 has a lower priority than SRB1 and can only be configured by the network after AS security activation.
In downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e. with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and connection resume.
NOTE 1:	The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 and SRB4, including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].
Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split SRB is not supported for SRB0, SRB3 and SRB4).
For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3 are assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC), (i.e. CAPC = 1) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.

5	Procedures
5.1	General
5.1.1	Introduction
This clause covers the general requirements.
5.1.2	General requirements
The UE shall:
1>	process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a subsequent message;
NOTE:	Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE's response of a previously initiated procedure.
1>	within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the procedural description;
1>	consider the term 'radio bearer' (RB) to cover SRBs, DRBs and MRBs unless explicitly stated otherwise;
1>	set the rrc-TransactionIdentifier in the response message, if included, to the same value as included in the message received from the network that triggered the response message;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to setup:
2>	apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1>	upon receiving a choice value set to release:
2>	clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated resources;
1>	in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension field comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field (regardless of whether the network signals more entries in total); apply the following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:
2>	create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among both the original and the additional entries;
2>	for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same behaviour as defined for the original field.
5.1.3	Requirements for UE in MR-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be in:
-	EN-DC, if and only if it is configured with nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to EPC,
-	NGEN-DC, if and only if it is configured with nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to 5GC,
-	NE-DC, if and only if it is configured with mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup set to eutra-SCG,
-	NR-DC, if and only if it is configured with mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup set to nr-SCG,
-	MR-DC, if and only if it is in (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC.
NOTE:	This use of these terms deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [41] and other specifications. In TS 37.340, these terms include also the case where the UE is configured with E-UTRA or NR MCG only (i.e. no NR or E-UTRA SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary node (i.e. using NR PDCP).
The UE in (NG)EN-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 in this specification when the subclause:
-	is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this specification or in TS 36.331 [10]; or
-	applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or
-	applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this specification that the UE is configured with.
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE follows the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this specification applicable to the messages (including processing time requirements), fields, IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the subclause under execution.
5.2	System information
5.2.1	Introduction
System Information (SI) is divided into the MIB and a number of SIBs and posSIBs where:
-	the MIB is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80 ms and repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.1) and it includes parameters that are needed to acquire SIB1 from the cell. The first transmission of the MIB is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;
NOTE 1:	If the period of SSB is larger than 80 ms, the MIB is transmitted with the same periodicity as that of SSB.
-	the SIB1 is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of SIB1 is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, SIB1 repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2/3, SIB1 transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). SIB1 includes information regarding the availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity, SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE to perform the SI request. SIB1 is cell-specific SIB;
-	SIBs other than SIB1 and posSIBs are carried in SystemInformation (SI) messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs or posSIBs having the same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. SIBs and posSIBs are mapped to the different SI messages. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An SI message may be transmitted a number of times within the SI-window. Any SIB or posSIB except SIB1 can be configured to be cell specific or area specific, using an indication in SIB1. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is identified by systemInformationAreaID;
-	The mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in schedulingInfoList and schedulingInfoList2, while the mapping of posSIBs to SI messages is configured in posSchedulingInfoList and schedulingInfoList2. SIBs and posSIBs are mapped to separate SI messages even when configured using a common schedulingInfoList2. Each SIB is contained only in a single SI message. In the case of posSIB, a posSIB carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for different GNSS/SBAS [49] is contained in different SI messages. Each SIB and posSIB, including a posSIB carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for one GNSS/SBAS, is contained at most once in that SI message;
-	For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information through dedicated signalling using the RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor system information, paging, or upon request from the UE.
-	For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated signalling, i.e. within an RRCReconfiguration message. Nevertheless, the UE shall acquire MIB of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, the required SI can only be changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.
NOTE 2:	The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take. The maximum SIB1 or SI message size is 2976 bits.
5.2.2	System information acquisition
5.2.2.1	General UE requirements

Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition
The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.
The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at least) the MIB, SIB1 through SIB4, SIB5 (if the UE supports E-UTRA), SIB11 (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), SIB12 (if UE is capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery), and SIB13, SIB14 (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication), SIB15 (if UE is configured by upper layers to report disaster roaming related information), SIB16 (if the UE is capable of slice-based cell reselection and the UE receives NSAG information for cell reselection from upper layer), SIB17 (if the UE is using TRS resources for power saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE) and SIB19 (if UE is accessing NR via NTN access).
The UE capable of MBS broadcast which is receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) via a broadcast MRB shall ensure having a valid version of SIB20 and SIB21, regardless of the RRC state the UE is in.
The UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper layers.
5.2.2.2	SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
5.2.2.2.1	SIB validity
The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of a requested SIB.
When the UE acquires a MIB or a SIB1 or an SI message in a serving cell as described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the first PLMN-Identity in the PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentityInfoList for NPN-only cells, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, and the valueTag, if present, as indicated in the si-SchedulingInfo for the SIB. If the UE stores the acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated areaScope, if present, the cellIdentity, the systemInformationAreaID, if present, the valueTag, if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, and the expirationTime if provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element. The UE may use a valid stored version of the SI except MIB, SIB1, SIB6, SIB7 or SIB8 e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after the reception of SI change indication. The valueTag and expirationTime for posSIB is optionally provided in assistanceDataSIB-Element, as specified in TS 37.355 [49].
A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can inform the interested SIB(s) to the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.8.2 and receive the SIB(s) from the L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.8.3. A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED receives SIB1 and other SIB(s) in RRCReconfiguration message and performs on-demand SI request if required, as defined in clause 5.2.2.3.5 and 5.2.2.3.6. The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED is not required to obtain SI over Uu interface, but it may decide to perform the SI acquisition procedure over Uu interface as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 by UE implementation.
NOTE:	The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.

5.2.2.2.2	SI change indication and PWS notification
A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI message (other than SI message for ETWS, CMAS, positioning assistance data, and some NTN-specific information as specified in the field descriptions ) is broadcasted in the modification period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m = 0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period. The modification period is configured by system information. If H-SFN is provided in SIB1, and UE is configured with eDRX, modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod m = 0.
For UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE configured to use an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition period is defined. The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values for which H-SFN mod 1024 = 0.
The UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding modification period or within preceding eDRX acquisition period. SI change indication is not applicable for SI messages containing posSIBs.
UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing shall monitor for SI change indication in own paging occasion every DRX cycle. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.
UEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall monitor for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period, if the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT procedure is ongoing is associated with a CD-SSB.
During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or stopped, the SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in posSchedulingInfoList may change, so the UE might not be able to successfully receive those posSIBs in the remainder of the current modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling information received prior to the change.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing shall monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own paging occasion every DRX cycle. ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle if the UE is provided with common search space, including pagingSearchSpace, searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, on the active BWP to monitor paging.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least once every defaultPagingCycle, if the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT procedure is ongoing is associated with a CD-SSB.
For Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 38.213 [13].
A L2 U2N Remote UE is not required to monitor paging occasion for SI modifications and/or PWS notifications. It obtains the updated system information and SIB6/7/8 from the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.9.3.
If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:
1>	if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the etwsAndCmasIndication bit of Short Message is set, and the UE is provided with searchSpaceSIB1 and searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation on the active BWP or the initial BWP:
2> immediately re-acquire the SIB1;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB6:
3>	acquire SIB6, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is ETWS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB7:
3>	acquire SIB7, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2>	if the UE is CMAS capable and si-SchedulingInfo includes scheduling information for SIB8:
3>	acquire SIB8, as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
NOTE:	In case SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8 overlap with a measurement gap it is left to UE implementation how to immediately acquire SIB6, SIB7, or SIB8.
1>	if the UE does not operate an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period and the systemInfoModification bit of Short Message is set:
2>	apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next modification period;
1>	if the UE operates an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period and the systemInfoModification-eDRX bit of Short Message is set:
2>	apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the start of the next eDRX acquisition period boundary.

5.2.2.3	Acquisition of System Information
5.2.2.3.1	Acquisition of MIB and SIB1
The UE shall:
1>	apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;

1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2>	acquire the MIB, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	if the UE is unable to acquire the MIB;
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;

1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1 and the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceSIB1, and, the UE has not stored a valid version of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, si-BroadcastStatus for the required SIB(s) or posSI-BroadcastStatus for the required posSIB(s) is set to notbroadcasting in acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1>	if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2>	if ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates SIB1 is transmitted in the cell (TS 38.213 [13]) and if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE:
3>	acquire the SIB1, which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
3>	if the UE is unable to acquire the SIB1:
4>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
3>	else:
4>	upon acquiring SIB1, perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
2>	else if SIB1 acquisition is required for the UE and ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is not scheduled in the cell:
3>	perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
NOTE 1:	The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 and MBS broadcast if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e., the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located. The UE in RRC_INACTIVE state while SDT procedure is ongoing, is only required to acquire broadcasted SIB1 and MIB if the UE can acquire them without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2:	UE in RRC_INACTIVE that does not support inactiveStateNTN-r17 enters RRC_IDLE upon cell reselection between TN cell and NTN cell, and initiates the NAS signalling connection recovery (see TS 24.501 [23]).
5.2.2.3.2	Acquisition of an SI message
For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined according to searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on search space indicated by searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation. PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion (s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI messages is up to UE implementation.
When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1>	determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as follows:
2>	if the concerned SI message is configured in the schedulingInfoList:
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
3>	determine the integer value x = (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	else if the concerned SI message is configured in the schedulingInfoList2;
3>	determine the integer value x = (si-WindowPosition -1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the si-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	else if the concerned SI message is configured in the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is not configured:
3>	create a concatenated list of SI messages by appending the posSchedulingInfoList in posSI-SchedulingInfo in SIB1 to schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo in SIB1;
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the concatenated list;
3>	determine the integer value x = (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N), where T is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2>	else if the concerned SI message is configured by the posSchedulingInfoList and offsetToSI-Used is configured:
3>	determine the number m which corresponds to the number of SI messages with an associated si-Periodicity of 8 radio frames (80 ms), configured by schedulingInfoList in SIB1;
3>	for the concerned SI message, determine the number n which corresponds to the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by posSchedulingInfoList in SIB1;
3>	determine the integer value x = m × w + (n – 1) × w, where w is the si-WindowLength;
3>	the SI-window starts at the slot #a, where a = x mod N, in the radio frame for which SFN mod T = FLOOR(x/N) +8, where T is the posSI-Periodicity of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
1>	receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in the PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in time is given by si-WindowLength, or until the SI message was received;
1>	if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the current modification period;
1>	if all the SIB(s) and/or posSIB(s) requested in DedicatedSIBRequest message have been acquired:
2>	stop timer T350, if running;
NOTE 1:	The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2:	The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.
NOTE 3:	If the concerned SI message was not received in the current modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE implementation.
NOTE 4:	A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may stop the PDCCH monitoring during the SI window for the concerned SI message when the requested SIB(s) are acquired.
NOTE 5:	A UE capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and configured by upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication/discovery on a frequency, may acquire SIB12 or SystemInformationBlockType28 from a cell other than current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED), if SIB12 of current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED) does not provide configuration for NR sidelink communication/discovery for the frequency, and if the other cell providing configuration for NR sidelink communication/discovery for the frequency meets the S-criteria as defined in TS 38.304 [20] or TS 36.304 [27].

5.3	Connection control
5.3.1	Introduction
5.3.1.1	RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message when AS security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g. used to establish SRB2, DRBs and multicast MRBs) are both integrity protected and ciphered. After having initiated the initial AS security activation procedure, the network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs and/or multicast MRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior to receiving the confirmation of the initial AS security activation from the UE. In any case, the network will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2, DRBs and/or multicast MRBs. The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS security activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A configuration with SRB2 without DRB or multicast MRB, or with DRB or multicast MRB without SRB2 is not supported (i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB must be configured in the same RRC Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to release all the DRBs and multicast MRBs without releasing the RRC Connection). For IAB-MT, a configuration with SRB2 without any DRB/MRB is supported.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA carrier frequency.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state. The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and ciphered.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN or for SDT. When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s) and/or multicast MRB(s), if configured.
Upon initiating the resume procedure for SDT, AS security (both ciphering and integrity protection) is re-activated for SRB2 (if configured for SDT) and for SRB1. In addition, AS security is also re-activated (if security is configured) for all the DRBs configured for SDT. Further, the PDCP entities of SRB1 and PDCP entities of the radio bearers configured for SDT are re-established and resumed whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state. Transmission and reception of data and/or signalling messages over radio bearers configured for SDT can happen whilst the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state and SDT procedure is ongoing.
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection or in response to a resume procedure initiated for SDT, the network may resume the suspended RRC connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in this case the network sends an RRC setup message).
NOTE:	In case the UE receives the configurations for NR sidelink communication via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in clause 5.3 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331[10], respectively.
5.3.1.2	AS Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and two parameters, namely the keySetChangeIndicator and the nextHopChainingCount, which are used by the UE to determine the AS security keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-establishment and/or connection resume.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured), SRB4 (if configured) and DRBs configured with integrity protection, with the same keyToUse value. The ciphering algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured), SRB4 (if configured) and DRBs configured with the same keyToUse value. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering applies for SRB0.
NOTE 0:	All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same enable/disable setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting for integrity protection, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a 'NULL' ciphering algorithm (nea0).
The 'NULL' integrity protection algorithm (nia0) is used only for SRBs and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′NULL' integrity protection algorithm is used, 'NULL' ciphering algorithm is also used.
NOTE 1:	Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check failure to RRC.
The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection of RRC signalling (KRRCint), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling (KRRCenc), one for integrity protection of user data (KUPint) and one for the ciphering of user data (KUPenc). All four AS keys are derived from the KgNB key. The KgNB key is based on the KAMF key (as specified in TS 33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (KgNB, KRRCint, KRRCenc, KUPint and KUPenc) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if masterKeyUpdate is included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (COUNT, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the COUNT is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection.
It is not allowed to use the same COUNT value more than once for a given security key. As specified in TS 33.501 clause 6.9.4.1 [11], the network is responsible for avoiding reuse of the COUNT with the same RB identity and with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-UM bearers and multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g. use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key, or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED transition.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (HFN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the UE and the network.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is the value of the corresponding srb-Identity with the MSBs padded with zeroes.
For a UE provided with an sk-counter, keyToUse indicates whether the UE uses the master key (KgNB) or the secondary key (S-KeNB or S-KgNB) for a particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the master key and sk-Counter, as defined in TS 33.501[11]. Whenever there is a need to refresh the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN with KgNB change or to avoid COUNT reuse, the security key update is used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC, the network may provide a UE configured with an SCG with an sk-Counter even when no DRB is setup using the secondary key (S-KgNB) in order to allow the configuration of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an sk-Counter, even if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.
5.3.2	Paging
5.3.2.1	General

Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging
The purpose of this procedure is:

-	to transmit paging information for a L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE to its serving L2 U2N Relay UE in any RRC state.
5.3.2.2	Initiation
The network initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the Paging message at the UE's paging occasion as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. The network may address multiple UEs within a Paging message by including one PagingRecord for each UE. The network may also include one or multiple TMGI(s) in the Paging message to page UEs for specific MBS multicast session(s).

5.3.3	RRC connection establishment
5.3.3.1	General

Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful

Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to the network.
The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:
-	When establishing an RRC connection;
-	When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case, UE receives RRCSetup and responds with RRCSetupComplete.
5.3.3.1a	Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for NR sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication/discovery, an RRC connection establishment is initiated only in the following cases:
1>	if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery and related data is available for transmission:
2>	if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency; or
2>	if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink discovery is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 includes neither sl-DiscTxPoolSelected nor sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency;
For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_IDLE, an RRC connection establishment is initiated in the following cases:
1>	if any message is received from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;
For V2X sidelink communication, an RRC connection is initiated only when the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS 36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE:	Upper layers initiate an RRC connection (except if the RRC connection is initiated at the L2 U2N Relay UE upon reception of a message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1). The interaction with NAS is left to UE implementation.
5.3.3.2	Initiation
The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request establishment of an RRC connection while the UE is in RRC_IDLE and it has acquired essential system information, or for sidelink communication as specified in clause 5.3.3.1a.
The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this procedure.
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more Access Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:
2>	perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper layers;
3>	if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
1>	if the upper layers provide NSAG information and one or more S-NSSAI(s) triggering the access attempt (TS 23.501 [32] and TS 24.501 [23]):
2>	apply the NSAG with highest NSAG priority among the NSAGs that are included in SIB1 (i.e., in FeatureCombination and in RA-PrioritizationSliceInfo), and that are associated with the S-NSSAI(s) triggering the access attempt, in the Random Access procedure (TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1);
1>	if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Remote UE:
2>	establish a SRAP entity as specified in TS 38.351 [66], if no SRAP entity has been established;
2>	apply the specified configuration of SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4;
2>	apply the SDAP configuration and PDCP configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2 for SRB0;
1>	else:
2>	apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIB1;
2>	apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
2>	apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;
2>	apply the timeAlignmentTimerCommon included in SIB1;
1>	start timer T300;
1>	initiate transmission of the RRCSetupRequest message in accordance with 5.3.3.3;
5.3.3.3	Actions related to transmission of RRCSetupRequest message
The UE shall set the contents of RRCSetupRequest message as follows:
1>	set the ue-Identity as follows:
2>	if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:
3>	set the ue-Identity to ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1;
2>	else:
3>	draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..239-1 and set the ue-Identity to this value;
NOTE 1:	Upper layers provide the 5G-S-TMSI if the UE is registered in the TA of the current cell.
1>	if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release with redirect with mpsPriorityIndication (either in NR or E-UTRAN):
2>	set the establishmentCause to mps-PriorityAccess;
1>	else:
2>	set the establishmentCause in accordance with the information received from upper layers;
NOTE 2:	In case the L2 U2N Relay UE initiates RRC connection establishment triggered by reception of message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 5.3.3.1a, the L2 U2N Relay UE sets the establishmentCause by implementation, but it can only set the emergency, mps-PriorityAccess, or mcs-PriorityAccess as establishmentCause if the same cause value is in the message received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0.
1>	if ta-Report is configured with value enabled and the UE supports TA reporting:
2>	indicate TA report initiation to lower layers;
The UE shall submit the RRCSetupRequest message to lower layers for transmission.
If the UE is a RedCap UE and the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP is not associated with CD-SSB, the UE may continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell re-selection evaluation, otherwise the UE shall continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell re-selection evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection are fulfilled, the UE shall perform cell re-selection as specified in 5.3.3.6.
NOTE 3:	For L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE, the cell (re)selection procedure as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and relay (re)selection procedure as specified in 5.8.15.3 are performed independently and up to UE implementation to select either a cell or a L2 U2N Relay UE.

Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful

Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection establishment.
5.3.4.2	Initiation

5.3.5	RRC reconfiguration
5.3.5.1	General

Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful

Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to establish/modify/release RBs/BH RLC channels/Uu Relay RLC channels/PC5 Relay RLC channels, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to setup/modify/release measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell groups, to add/modify/release conditional handover configuration, to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change or conditional PSCell addition configuration. As part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the Network to the UE.
RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but is not limited to, the following cases:
-	reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
-	reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving RA to the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
-	reconfiguration with sync for DAPS and security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
-	for non-DAPS bearer: refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
-	for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for the target PCell, refresh of security and reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
-	for SRB: refresh of security and establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell;
-	reconfiguration with sync for DAPS but without security key refresh, involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
-	for non-DAPS bearer: RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
-	for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for target PCell, reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
-	for SRB: establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell.
-	reconfiguration with sync for direct-to-indirect path switch, not involving RA at target side, involving re-establishment of PDCP /PDCP data recovery (for AM DRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and reporting, for UE assistance (re-)configuration and reporting for power savings, for IP address (re-)configuration and reporting for IAB-nodes, to (re-)configure MAC, RLC, BAP, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the S-KgNB or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs associated with S-KgNB in NGEN-DC and NR-DC, and to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change configuration, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any MN involvement, and to transmit RRC messages between the MN and the UE during fast MCG link recovery. In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, only measConfig, radioBearerConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, bap-Config, iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList, otherConfig and/or secondaryCellGroup are included in RRCReconfiguration received via SRB3, except when RRCReconfiguration is received within DLInformationTransferMRDC.
5.3.5.2	Initiation
The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the establishment of BH RLC Channels for IAB is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the establishment of Uu Relay RLC channels and PC5 Relay RLC channels (other than SL-RLC0 and SL-RLC1) for L2 U2N Relay UE is performed only when AS security has been activated, and the establishment of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Remote UE (other than SL-RLC0 and SL-RLC1) is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS security has been activated;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in secondaryCellGroup only when at least one RLC bearer or BH RLC channel is setup in SCG;
-	the reconfigurationWithSync is included in masterCellGroup only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended;
-	the conditionalReconfiguration for CPC is included only when at least one RLC bearer is setup in SCG;
-	the conditionalReconfiguration for CHO or CPA is included only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended.

3>	configure lower layers in accordance with the received spCellConfigCommon;
3>	configure lower layers in accordance with any additional fields, not covered in the previous, if included in the received reconfigurationWithSync.
2>	if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Remote UE at the source side:
3>	indicate upper layer to trigger PC5 unicast link release.
Upon L2 U2N Relay UE receiving reconfigurationWithSync, it either indicates to upper layers (to trigger PC5 unicast link release) or sends Notification message to the connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) in accordance with 5.8.9.10.
5.3.5.5.3	RLC bearer release
The UE shall:

NOTE 1:	For DRB and SRB, the network does not re-associate an already configured logical channel with another radio bearer. Hence, servedRadioBearer is not present in this case. For MRB, the network does not re-associate an already configured logical channel with DRB or SRB or another MRB (i.e. MRB with another PDCP entity). Hence multicastRLC-BearerConfig is not present in this case. If a radio bearer is released and another is added with the same radio bearer identity, it is considered as a new (different) radio bearer. Hence, the network also releases the RLC bearer(s) associated with the released radio bearer.
NOTE 2:	In DAPS handover, the UE may perform RLC entity re-establishment (if reestablishRLC is set) for an RLC bearer associated with a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3].

NOTE 2:	When determining whether a drb-Identity value is part of the current UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which RadioBearerConfig and DRB-ToAddModList that DRB was originally configured in. To re-associate a DRB with a different key (KeNB to S-KgNB, KgNB to S-KeNB, KgNB to S-KgNB, or vice versa), the network provides the drb-Identity value in the (target) drb-ToAddModList and sets the reestablishPDCP flag. The network does not list the drb-Identity in the (source) drb-ToReleaseList.
NOTE 3:	When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 4:	In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled for a DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection can be changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.
NOTE 6:	In DAPS handover, the UE may perform PDCP entity re-establishment (if reestablishPDCP is set) or the PDCP data recovery (if recoverPDCP is set) for a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. In this case, the UE suspends data transmission and reception for all non-DAPS bearers in the source MCG for duration of the DAPS handover.
5.3.5.6.6	Multicast MRB release
The UE shall:
1>	for each mrb-Identity value included in the mrb-ToReleaseList that is part of the current UE configuration; or
1>	for each mrb-Identity value that is to be released as the result of full configuration according to 5.3.5.11:
2>	release the PDCP entity and the mrb-Identity;
2>	if there is no other multicast MRB configured with the same mbs-SessionId as configured for the released multicast MRB:
3>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers.
NOTE 1:	The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the mrb-ToReleaseList includes any mrb-Identity value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
NOTE 2:	Whether or not the RLC and MAC entities associated with this PDCP entity are reset or released is determined by the CellGroupConfig.
5.3.5.6.7	Multicast MRB addition/modification
The UE shall for each element in the order of entry in the list mrb-ToAddModList:
1>	if mrb-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList is part of the UE configuration:
2>	if mrb-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList for which mrb-IdentityNew is included (i.e., multicast MRB ID change):
3>	update the mrb-Identity to the value mrb-IdentityNew;
2>	if the reestablishPDCP is set:
3>	if drb-ContinueROHC is included in pdcp-Config:
4>	indicate to lower layer that drb-ContinueROHC is configured;
3>	if drb-ContinueEHC-DL is included in pdcp-Config:
4>	indicate to lower layer that drb-ContinueEHC-DL is configured;
3>	re-establish the PDCP entity of this multicast MRB as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.1.2;
2>	else, if the recoverPDCP is set:
3>	trigger the PDCP entity of this MRB to perform data recovery as specified in TS 38.323 [5];
2>	if the pdcp-Config is included:
3>	reconfigure the PDCP entity in accordance with the received pdcp-Config;
1>	else if mrb-Identity value included in the mrb-ToAddModList is not part of the UE configuration (i.e., multicast MRB establishment including the case when full configuration option is used):
2>	establish a PDCP entity and configure it in accordance with the received pdcp-Config;
2>	associate the established multicast MRB with the corresponding mbs-SessionId;
2>	if an SDAP entity with the received mbs-SessionId does not exist:
3>	establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1;
3>	if an SDAP entity with the received mbs-SessionId did not exist prior to receiving this reconfiguration:
4>	indicate the establishment of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers.
NOTE 1:	When setting the reestablishPDCP flag for a radio bearer, the network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to the re-established PDCP entity. The network does that e.g. by triggering a reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 2:	In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 3:	When updating the mrb-Identity, the network ensures new MRBs are listed at the end of the mrb-ToAddModList if they have the same MRB ID as in the existing UE configuration.
5.3.5.7	AS Security key update
The UE shall:
1>	if UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC:

4>	derive the KRRCint and KUPint keys associated with the current integrityProtAlgorithm, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
NOTE 1:	Ciphering and integrity protection are optional to configure for the DRBs.
1>	else if this procedure was initiated due to reception of the sk-Counter (UE is in NE-DC, or NR-DC, or is configured with SN terminated bearer(s)):
2>	derive or update the secondary key (S-KgNB or S-KeNB) based on the KgNB key and using the received sk-Counter value, as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2>	derive the KRRCenc key and the KUPenc key as specified in TS 33.501 [11] using the ciphering algorithms indicated in the RadioBearerConfig associated with the secondary key (S-KgNB or S-KeNB) as indicated by keyToUse;
2>	derive the KRRCint key and the KUPint key as specified in TS 33.501 [11] using the integrity protection algorithms indicated in the RadioBearerConfig associated with the secondary key (S-KgNB or S-KeNB) as indicated by keyToUse;
NOTE 2:	If the UE has no radio bearer configured with keyToUse set to secondary and receives the sk-Counter without any RadioBearerConfig with keyToUse set to secondary, the UE does not consider it as an invalid reconfiguration.

3>	release the BAP entity as specified in TS 38.340 [47], if there is no configured bap-Config;
3>	release iab-IP-AddressConfigurationList associated with the SCG, if configured;
2>	else if the UE is configured with E-UTRA SCG:
3>	release the SCG configuration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.3.10.19 to release the E-UTRA SCG;
5.3.5.11	Full configuration
The UE shall:
1>	release/ clear all current dedicated radio configurations except for the following:
-	the MCG C-RNTI;
-	the AS security configurations associated with the master key;
-	the SRB1/SRB2 configurations and DRB/multicast MRB configurations as configured by radioBearerConfig or radioBearerConfig2.
NOTE 1:	Radio configuration is not just the resource configuration but includes other configurations like MeasConfig. Radio configuration also includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by RLC-BearerConfig, PC5 Relay RLC channel as configured by SL-RLC-ChannelConfig, and Uu Relay RLC channel as configured by Uu-RelayRLC-ChannelConfig. In case NR-DC or NE-DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR or E-UTRA SCG configuration which are released according to the MR-DC release procedure as specified in 5.3.5.10.
NOTE 1a:	For NR sidelink communication/discovery, the radio configuration includes the sidelink RRC configuration received from the network, but does not include the sidelink RRC reconfiguration and sidelink UE capability received from other UEs via PC5-RRC. In addition, the UE considers the new NR sidelink configurations as full configuration, in case of state transition and change of system information used for NR sidelink communication/discovery.
NOTE 1b:	To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to fullConfig, the network can include the srb-Identity within srb-ToAddModList (i.e. the UE applies RLC default configuration) and/or provide rlc-BearerToAddModList of concerned SRB(s) explicitly.
-	the logged measurement configuration;
1>	if the spCellConfig in the masterCellGroup includes the reconfigurationWithSync:
2>	release/ clear all current common radio configurations;
2>	if sl-PathSwitchConfig was included in reconfigurationWithSync:
3>	use the default values specified in 9.2.3 for timer T311;
2>	else:
3>	use the default values specified in 9.2.3 for timers T310, T311 and constants N310, N311;
1>	else (full configuration after re-establishment or during RRC resume):
2>	if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Remote UE:
3>	use value for timer T311, as included in ue-TimersAndConstants received in SIB1
2>	else:
3>	use values for timers T301, T310, T311 and constants N310, N311, as included in ue-TimersAndConstants received in SIB1;
1>	if no measConfigAppLayerId is included:
2>	inform upper layers about the release of all application layer measurement configurations;
2>	discard any received application layer measurement report from upper layers;
2>	consider itself not to be configured to send application layer measurement report.
1>	if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Remote UE at the target side during reconfiguration with sync, or after re-establishment, or during RRC resume:
2>	apply the default configuration of SL-RLC1 as specified in clause 9.2.4 and associate it with the SRB1;
1>	else:
2>	apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the following:
-	parameters for which values are provided in SIB1;
2>	apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
2>	for each srb-Identity value included in the srb-ToAddModList (SRB reconfiguration):
3>	establish an RLC entity for the corresponding SRB;
3>	apply the default SRB configuration defined in 9.2.1 for the corresponding SRB;
NOTE 2:	This is to get the SRBs (SRB1 and SRB2 for reconfiguration with sync and SRB2 for resume and reconfiguration after re-establishment) to a known state from which the reconfiguration message can do further configuration.
1>	for each pdu-Session that is part of the current UE configuration:
2>	release the SDAP entity (clause 5.1.2 in TS 37.324 [24]);
2>	release each DRB associated to the pdu-Session as specified in 5.3.5.6.4;
NOTE 3:	This will retain the pdu-Session but remove the DRBs including drb-identity of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup of the DRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.5 using the new configuration. The pdu-Session acts as the anchor for associating the released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with a new DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).
1>	for each mbs-SessionId that is part of the current UE configuration and associated to a multicast MRB:
2>	release the SDAP entity (clause 5.1.2 in TS 37.324 [24]);
2>	release each multicast MRB associated to the mbs-SessionId as specified in 5.3.5.6.6;
NOTE 4:	This will retain the mbs-SessionId but remove the multicast MRBs including mrb-identity of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup of the multicast MRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.7 using the new configuration. The mbs-SessionId acts as the anchor for associating the released and re-setup multicast MRB. In the AS the multicast MRB re-setup is equivalent with a new multicast MRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).
1>	for each pdu-Session that is part of the current UE configuration but not added with same pdu-Session in the drb-ToAddModList:
2>	if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:
3>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the pdu-Session to upper layers after successful reconfiguration with sync;
2>	else:
3>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the pdu-Session to upper layers immediately;
1>	for each mbs-SessionId that is part of the current UE configuration but not added with the same mbs-SessionId in the mrb-ToAddModList:
2>	if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:
3>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers after successful reconfiguration with sync;
2>	else:
3>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers immediately.
5.3.5.12	BAP configuration
The IAB-MT shall:
1>	if the bap-Config is set to setup:

5.3.5.13	Conditional Reconfiguration
5.3.5.13.1	General
The network configures the UE with one or more candidate target SpCells in the conditional reconfiguration. The UE evaluates the condition of each configured candidate target SpCell. The UE applies the conditional reconfiguration associated with one of the target SpCells which fulfils associated execution condition. The network provides the configuration parameters for the target SpCell in the ConditionalReconfiguration IE.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent conditionalReconfiguration:
-	a conditionalReconfiguration associated with MCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1; and
-	a conditionalReconfiguration, associated with SCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included within a RRCReconfiguration message embedded in a RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1.
In this case:
-	the UE maintains two independent VarConditionalReconfig, one associated with each conditionalReconfiguration;
-	the UE independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.3.5.13 for each conditionalReconfiguration and the associated VarConditionalReconfig, unless explicitly stated otherwise;
-	the UE performs the procedures in clause 5.5 for the VarConditionalReconfig associated with the same cell group like the measConfig.
In EN-DC, the VarConditionalReconfig is associated with the SCG.
In NE-DC and when no SCG is configured, the VarConditionalReconfig is associated with the MCG.
The UE performs the following actions based on a received ConditionalReconfiguration IE:
1>	if the ConditionalReconfiguration contains the condReconfigToRemoveList:
2>	perform conditional reconfiguration removal procedure as specified in 5.3.5.13.2;
1>	if the ConditionalReconfiguration contains the condReconfigToAddModList:
2>	perform conditional reconfiguration addition/modification as specified in 5.3.5.13.3;
5.3.5.13.2	Conditional reconfiguration removal
The UE shall:
1>	for each condReconfigId value included in the condReconfigToRemoveList that is part of the current UE conditional reconfiguration in VarConditionalReconfig:
2>	remove the entry with the matching condReconfigId from the VarConditionalReconfig;
NOTE:	The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the condReconfigToRemoveList includes any condReconfigId value that is not part of the current UE configuration.
5.3.5.13.3	Conditional reconfiguration addition/modification
For each condReconfigId received in the condReconfigToAddModList IE the UE shall:
1>	if an entry with the matching condReconfigId exists in the condReconfigToAddModList within the VarConditionalReconfig:

3>	replace condExecutionCond or condExecutionCondSCG within the VarConditionalReconfig with the value received for this condReconfigId;
2>	if the entry in condReconfigToAddModList includes an condRRCReconfig;
3>	replace condRRCReconfig within the VarConditionalReconfig with the value received for this condReconfigId;
1>	else:
2>	add a new entry for this condReconfigId within the VarConditionalReconfig;
1>	perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation as specified in 5.3.5.13.4;
5.3.5.13.4	Conditional reconfiguration evaluation
The UE shall:
1>	for each condReconfigId within the VarConditionalReconfig:
2>	if the RRCReconfiguration within condRRCReconfig includes the masterCellGroup including the reconfigurationWithSync:
3>	consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value indicated in the ServingCellConfigCommon included in the reconfigurationWithSync within the masterCellGroup in the received condRRCReconfig to be applicable cell;
2>	else if the RRCReconfiguration within condRRCReconfig includes the secondaryCellGroup including the reconfigurationWithSync:
3>	consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value indicated in the ServingCellConfigCommon included in the reconfigurationWithSync within the secondaryCellGroup within the received condRRCReconfig to be applicable cell;
2>	if condExecutionCondSCG is configured:
3>	in the remainder of the procedure, consider each measId indicated in the condExecutionCondSCG as a measId in the VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig;
2>	if condExecutionCond is configured:
3>	if it is configured via SRB3 or configured within nr-SCG or within nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig (specified in TS 36.331[10]) via SRB1:
4>	in the remainder of the procedure, consider each measId indicated in the condExecutionCond as a measId in the VarMeasConfig associated with the SCG measConfig;

5.3.6	Counter check
5.3.6.1	General

Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT match with the values indicated by the network.
NOTE:	The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an intruder (a 'man in the middle').
5.3.6.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure by sending a CounterCheck message.
NOTE:	The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values reaches a specific value.
5.3.6.3	Reception of the CounterCheck message by the UE
Upon receiving the CounterCheck message, the UE shall:
1>	for each DRB that is established:
2>	if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3>	assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2>	if the drb-Identity is not included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;
2>	else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT are different from the value indicated in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList:
3>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink set to the value of TX_NEXT – 1 and RX_NEXT – 1 (specified in TS 38.323 [5]), respectively;
1>	for each DRB that is included in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList in the CounterCheck message that is not established:
2>	include the DRB in the drb-CountInfoList in the CounterCheckResponse message by including the drb-Identity, the count-Uplink and the count-Downlink with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding values in the drb-CountMSB-InfoList and the least significant bits set to zero;
1>	submit the CounterCheckResponse message to lower layers for transmission upon which the procedure ends.
5.3.7	RRC connection re-establishment
5.3.7.1	General
	
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
	

Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least one DRB/multicast MRB setup or, for IAB, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an RRCSetup according to clause 5.3.3.4.
The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:
-	When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies the UE context:
-	to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
-	to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
-	When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context:
-	to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels and Uu Relay RLC channels;
-	to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.
If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'other'. If AS security has been activated, but SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are not setup, the UE does not initiate the procedure but instead moves to RRC_IDLE directly, with release cause 'RRC connection failure'.

5.3.8.1	General

Figure 5.3.8.1-1: RRC connection release, successful
The purpose of this procedure is:
-	to release the RRC connection, which includes the release of the established radio bearers (except for broadcast MRBs), BH RLC channels, Uu Relay RLC channels, PC5 Relay RLC channels as well as all radio resources; or
-	to suspend the RRC connection only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup, which includes the suspension of the established radio bearers (except for broadcast MRBs).
5.3.8.2	Initiation
The network initiates the RRC connection release procedure to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE; or to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, is setup in RRC_CONNECTED; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE back to RRC_INACTIVE when the UE tries to resume (for resuming a suspended RRC connection or for initiating SDT); or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE when the UE tries to resume (for resuming of a suspended RRC connection or for initiating SDT). The procedure can also be used to release and redirect a UE to another frequency.

The purpose of this procedure is to resume a suspended RRC connection, including resuming SRB(s), DRB(s) and multicast MRB(s) or perform an RNA update. This procedure is also used to initiate SDT in RRC_INACTIVE.
5.3.13.1a	Conditions for resuming RRC Connection for NR sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication/discovery an RRC connection is resumed only in the following cases:
1>	if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery and related data is available for transmission:
2>	if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink communication is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency; or
2>	if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink discovery is included in sl-FreqInfoList within SIB12 provided by the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of SIB12 does not include sl-DiscTxPoolSelected or sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal for the concerned frequency;
For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_INACTIVE, an RRC connection establishment is resumed in the following cases:
1>	if any message is received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;
For V2X sidelink communication an RRC connection resume is initiated only when the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS 36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE:	Upper layers initiate an RRC connection resume (except if the RRC connection resume is initiated at the L2 U2N Relay UE upon reception of a message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1). The interaction with NAS is left to UE implementation.
5.3.13.1b	Conditions for initiating SDT
A UE in RRC_INACTIVE initiates the resume procedure for SDT when all of the following conditions are fulfilled:
1>	the upper layers request resumption of RRC connection; and
1>	SIB1 includes sdt-ConfigCommon; and
1>	sdt-Config is configured; and
1>	all the pending data in UL is mapped to the radio bearers configured for SDT; and
1>	for a RedCap UE when RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP includes no CD-SSB, ncd-SSB-RedCapInitialBWP-SDT is configured; and
1>	lower layers indicate that conditions for initiating SDT as specified in TS 38.321 [3] are fulfilled.
NOTE:	How the UE determines that all pending data in UL is mapped to radio bearers configured for SDT is left to UE implementation.
5.3.13.2	Initiation
The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers or AS (when responding to RAN paging, upon triggering RNA updates while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, for NR sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication as specified in clause 5.3.13.1a) requests the resume of a suspended RRC connection or requests the resume for initiating SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.1b.
The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this procedure.
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered by response to NG-RAN paging:
2>	select '0' as the Access Category;
2>	perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the selected Access Category and one or more Access Identities provided by upper layers;
3>	if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
1>	else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered by upper layers:
2>	if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more Access Identities:
3>	perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper layers;
4>	if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
2>	if the upper layers provide NSAG information and one or more S-NSSAI(s) triggering the access attempt (TS 23.501 [32] and TS 24.501 [23]):

2>	if the resumption occurs after release with redirect with mpsPriorityIndication:
3>	set the resumeCause to mps-PriorityAccess;
2>	else:
3>	set the resumeCause in accordance with the information received from upper layers;
1>	else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered due to an RNA update as specified in 5.3.13.8:
2>	if an emergency service is ongoing:
NOTE 1:	How the RRC layer in the UE is aware of an ongoing emergency service is up to UE implementation.
3>	select '2' as the Access Category;
3>	set the resumeCause to emergency;
2>	else:
3>	select '8' as the Access Category;
2>	perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using the selected Access Category and one or more Access Identities to be applied as specified in TS 24.501 [23];
3>	if the access attempt is barred:
4>	set the variable pendingRNA-Update to true;
4>	the procedure ends;
NOTE 2:	In case the L2 U2N Relay UE initiates RRC connection resume triggered by reception of message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 5.3.13.1a, the L2 U2N Relay UE sets the resumeCause by implementation, but it can only set the emergency, mps-PriorityAccess, or mcs-PriorityAccess as resumeCause, if the same cause value in the message received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0.

5.4	Inter-RAT mobility
5.4.1	Introduction
Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA, where E-UTRA can be connected to either EPC or 5GC, and from NR to UTRA-FDD is supported.
5.4.2	Handover to NR
5.4.2.1	General

Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network, transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g. E-UTRAN) to NR.
The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
5.4.2.2	Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending the RRCReconfiguration message via the radio access technology from which the inter-RAT handover is performed.
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated in the other RAT;
-	to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
5.4.2.3	Reception of the RRCReconfiguration by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are provided in SIB1;
1>	apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1>	perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
NOTE:	If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered when the UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.
5.4.3	Mobility from NR
5.4.3.1	General

-	handover, i.e. the MobilityFromNRCommand message includes radio resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
5.4.3.2	Initiation
The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, possibly in response to a MeasurementReport or an MCGFailureInformation message, by sending a MobilityFromNRCommand message. The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB are setup and not suspended;
-	the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
5.4.3.3	Reception of the MobilityFromNRCommand by the UE
The UE shall:
1>	stop timer T310, if running;
1>	stop timer T312, if running;
1>	if T316 is running:
2>	stop timer T316;
2>	clear the information included in VarRLF-Report, if any;
1>	if T390 is running:
2>	stop timer T390 for all access categories;
2>	perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;

2>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
2>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1>	else if the targetRAT-Type is set to utra-fdd:
2>	consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;
2>	forward the nas-SecurityParamFromNR to the upper layers, if included;
1>	access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance with the specifications of the target RAT.
5.4.3.4	Successful completion of the mobility from NR
Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
1>	reset MAC;
1>	stop all timers that are running except T325, T330 and T400;
1>	release ran-NotificationAreaInfo, if stored;
1>	release the AS security context including the KRRCenc key, the KRRCint key, the KUPint key and the KUPenc key, if stored;
1>	release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the MAC configuration;
1>	release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE :	PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover that are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during inter-RAT intra-system handover when fullConfig is not present) is used, are not released as part of this procedure.

5.5	Measurements
5.5.1	Introduction
The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements. The network may configure the UE to report them in accordance with the measurement configuration or perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation in accordance with the conditional reconfiguration. The measurement configuration is provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e. using the RRCReconfiguration or RRCResume.
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of measurements:
-	NR measurements;
-	Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies;
-	Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA-FDD frequencies;
-	NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on SS/PBCH block(s):
-	Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;
-	Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);
-	SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement information based on CSI-RS resources:
-	Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;
-	Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);
-	CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of measurements for NR sidelink and V2X sidelink:
-	CBR measurements.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement information based on SRS resources:
-	Measurement results per SRS resource;
-	SRS resource(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement information based on CLI-RSSI resources:
-	Measurement results per CLI-RSSI resource;
-	CLI-RSSI resource(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following Rx-Tx time difference measurement information based on CSI-RS for tracking or PRS:
-	UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement result.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
1.	Measurement objects: A list of objects on which the UE shall perform the measurements.
-	For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of reference signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object, the network may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of 'exclude-listed' cells and a list of 'allow-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Allow-listed cells are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	The measObjectId of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is indicated by servingCellMO within the serving cell configuration.
-	For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of 'exclude-listed' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
-	For inter-RAT UTRA-FDD measurements a measurement object is a set of cells on a single UTRA-FDD carrier frequency.
-	For NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs, a measurement object is a single NR sidelink frequency to be measured.
-	For CBR measurement of NR sidelink communication, a measurement object is a set of transmission resource pool(s) on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink communication.
-	For CBR measurement of NR sidelink discovery, a measurement object is a set of discovery dedicated resource pool(s) or transmission resource pool(s) also used for NR sidelink discovery on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink discovery.
-	For CLI measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time location of SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources, and subcarrier spacing of SRS resources to be measured.
2.	Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object. Each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
-	Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.
In case of conditional reconfiguration, each configuration consists of the following:
-	Execution criteria: The criteria the UE uses for conditional reconfiguration execution.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for obtaining beam and cell measurement results (SS/PBCH block-based or CSI-RS-based), used for evaluating conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
3.	Measurement identities: For measurement reporting, a list of measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger configuration. And up to 2 measurement identities can be linked to one conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
4.	Quantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for measurements per cell and per beam.
5.	Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly includes NR measurement object(s), CLI measurement object(s), inter-RAT objects, and L2 U2N Relay objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list includes NR, inter-RAT, and L2 U2N Relay reporting configurations. Any measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	The NR serving cell(s) – these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.
2.	Listed cells – these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3.	Detected cells – these are cells that are not listed within the measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving cell(s)/serving Relay UE (for L2 U2N Remote UE), listed cells and/or detected cells. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and detected cells and, for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements, the UE measures and reports on the configured resources on the indicated frequency. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of UTRA-FDD, the UE measures and reports on listed cells. For CLI measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on configured measurement resources (i.e. SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources). For L2 U2N Relay object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving NR cell(s), as well as the discovered L2 U2N Relay UEs.
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2, refers to a field it concerns a field included in the VarMeasConfig unless explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure covers the direct UE action related to the received measConfig.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent measConfig:
-	a measConfig, associated with MCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1; and
-	a measConfig, associated with SCG, that is included in the RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included within a RRCReconfiguration message embedded in a RRCReconfiguration message received via SRB1.
In this case, the UE maintains two independent VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, one associated with each measConfig, and independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each measConfig and the associated VarMeasConfig and VarMeasReportList, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
The configurations related to CBR measurements are only included in the measConfig associated with MCG.
The configurations related to Rx-Tx time difference measurement are only included in the measConfig associated with MCG.
5.5.2	Measurement configuration
5.5.2.1	General
The network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to ensure that, whenever the UE has a measConfig associated with a CG, it includes a measObject for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of the CG to be measured;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportCGI;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP entity using a reporting configuration with the ul-DelayValueConfig;
-	to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP entity using a reporting configuration with the ul-ExcessDelayConfig;
-	to ensure that, in the measConfig associated with a CG:
-	for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with the same ssbFrequency;
-	an smtc1 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc2 included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc3list included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value and that an smtc4list included in any measurement object with the same ssbFrequency has the same value;
-	to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and in TS 36.331 [10] with the same ssbFrequency have the same ssbSubcarrierSpacing;
-	to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object associated with the SCG:
-	for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
-	if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
-	to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same ssbFrequency as a measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
-	for that ssbFrequency, the measurement window according to the smtc configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the smtc1 configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
-	if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in measurementSlots in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to the same value. Also, the endSymbol is the same in both objects.
-	when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the reportType set to reportSFTD;
For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:
-	to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object have the same center frequency, (startPRB+floor(nrofPRBs/2))
-	to ensure that the total number of CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object does not exceed the maximum number specified in TS 38.214 [19].

2>	else, set parameter csi-RSRP of s-MeasureConfig within VarMeasConfig to the threshold value of the RSRP indicated by the received value of s-MeasureConfig which is derived as specified in 6.3.2.
5.5.2.2	Measurement identity removal
The UE shall:
1>	for each measId included in the received measIdToRemoveList that is part of the current UE configuration in VarMeasConfig:
2>	remove the entry with the matching measId from the measIdList within the VarMeasConfig;
2>	remove the measurement reporting entry for this measId from the VarMeasReportList, if included;
2>	stop the periodical reporting timer or timer T321 or timer T322, whichever one is running, and reset the associated information (e.g. timeToTrigger) for this measId.

5.5.2.10	Reference signal measurement timing configuration
The UE shall setup the first SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (providing Periodicity and Offset value for the following condition) in the smtc1 configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:
SFN mod T = (FLOOR (Offset/10));
if the Periodicity is larger than sf5:
subframe = Offset mod 10;
else:
subframe = Offset or (Offset +5);
with T = CEIL(Periodicity/10).
If smtc2 is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in smtc2 in the same MeasObjectNR, the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc2 configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtc1 configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the above condition.
If smtc2-LP is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in smtc2-LP in the same frequency (for intra frequency cell reselection) or different frequency (for inter frequency cell reselection), the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received periodicity parameter in the smtc2-LP configuration and use the Offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) and duration parameter from the smtc configuration for that frequency. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell or serving cell (for cell reselection) meeting the above condition.
If smtc3list is present, for cells indicated in the pci-List parameter in each SSB-MTC3 element of the list in the same MeasObjectNR, the IAB-MT shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in accordance with the received periodicityAndOffset parameter (using same condition as smtc1 to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion) in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and ssb-ToMeasure parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.

On the indicated ssbFrequency, the UE shall not consider SS/PBCH block transmission in subframes outside the SMTC occasion for RRM measurements based on SS/PBCH blocks and for RRM measurements based on CSI-RS except for SFTD measurement (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.3.8).
5.5.2.10a	RSSI measurement timing configuration
The UE shall setup the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) in accordance with the received rmtc-Periodicity and, if configured, with rmtc-SubframeOffset i.e. the first symbol of each RMTC occasion occurs at first symbol of an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:
SFN mod T = FLOOR(rmtc-SubframeOffset/10);
subframe = rmtc-SubframeOffset mod 10;
with T = rmtc-Periodicity/10;
On the frequency configured by rmtc-Frequency, the UE shall not consider RSSI measurements outside the configured RMTC occasion which lasts for measDurationSymbols for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements.
The UE derives the RSSI measurement duration from a combination of measDurationSymbols and ref-SCS-CP. At least for RSSI measurement confined within the active DL BWP, the UE performs RSSI measurement using the numerology of the active DL BWP during the derived measurement duration. Otherwise, the numerology used by the UE for measurements is up to UE implementation. If configured, the UE performs RSSI measurements on a bandwidth in accordance with the received rmtc-Bandwidth. If configured, the UE performs RSSI measurements according to the TCI state configured by tci-StateId in the reference BWP configured by ref-BWPId of the reference serving cell configured by ref-ServCellId (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.2A.7 and clause 9.3A.8).If the UE has no serving cell in FR2-2 and configured with inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2, it is up to the UE implementation how to determine the spatial domain filter for the inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2.

5.5.3	Performing measurements
5.5.3.1	General
An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcN0; RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2 quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements. The UE does not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the Rx-Tx time difference measurements.
The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a. If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive cell measurement results is implementation dependent.
The UE shall:

NOTE 1:	If k is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2:	The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation of reporting criteria or for measurement reporting, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic measurements.
NOTE 3:	The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].
NOTE 4:	For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to reset filtering upon BWP switch.

5.5.6	Location measurement indication
5.5.6.1	General

Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR (eutra-RSTD, nr-RSTD, nr-UE-RxTxTimeDiff, nr-PRS-RSRP) which require measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards E-UTRA (eutra-FineTimingDetection) which requires measurement gaps. UE shall initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.
NOTE:	It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
5.5.6.2	Initiation
The UE shall:
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or start subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA, and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2>	if preconfigured measurement gaps for positioning and posMG-Request are configured and the UE considers that at least one of the preconfigured measurement gaps for positioning is sufficient for the location measurement when activated:
3>	trigger the lower layers to initiate the measurement gap activation request using UL MAC CE as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
2> else:
3>	initiate the procedure to indicate start as specified in clause 5.5.6.3;
NOTE 1:	The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
NOTE 1a:	When indication is received from upper layers for performing location measurement and there is pre-configured measurement gap configured (not preconfigured measurement gap for positioning), the UE considers this preconfigured measurement gap to be not sufficient if the measurement gap is not considered to be always activated according to clause 9.1.7.2 of TS 38.133 [14].
1>	if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or stop subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:
2>	if there is no activated preconfigured measurement gap for positioning:
3>	if there is previously triggered UL MAC CE transmission for the measurement gap activation for positioning:
4>	indicate to the lower layers to cancel the triggered UL MAC CE transmission for the measurement gap activation as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
3>	else:
4>	initiate the procedure to indicate stop as specified in 5.5.6.3.
2>	else if there is activated preconfigured measurement gap for positioning:
3>	trigger the lower layers to deactivate all the activated measurement gap(s) for positioning as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
NOTE 2:	The UE may initiate the procedure to indicate stop even if it did not previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
5.5.6.3	Actions related to transmission of LocationMeasurementIndication message
The UE shall set the contents of LocationMeasurementIndication message as follows:
1>	if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of location related measurements:
2>	if the procedure is initiated for RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA:
3>	set the measurementIndication to the eutra-RSTD according to the information received from upper layers;
2>	else if the procedure is initiated for positioning measurement towards NR:
3>	set the measurementIndication to the nr-PRS-Measurement according to the information received from upper layers;
1>	else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of location related measurements:
2>	set the measurementIndication to the value release;
1>	if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:
2>	set the measurementIndication to the value eutra-FineTimingDetection;
1>	else if the procedure is initiated to indicate stop of subframe and slot timing detection towards E-UTRA:
2>	set the measurementIndication to the value release;
1>	submit the LocationMeasurementIndication message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.

5.5a.1.2	Initiation
NG-RAN initiates the logged measurement configuration procedure to UE in RRC_CONNECTED by sending the LoggedMeasurementConfiguration message.

5.6	UE capabilities
5.6.1	UE capability transfer
5.6.1.1	General
This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE capability information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the network.

Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer
5.6.1.2	Initiation
The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs (additional) UE radio access capability information. The network should retrieve UE capabilities only after AS security activation. Network does not forward UE capabilities that were retrieved before AS security activation to the CN.
5.6.1.3	Reception of the UECapabilityEnquiry by the UE
The UE shall set the contents of UECapabilityInformation message as follows:
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to nr:
2>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-NR-Capability and with the rat-Type set to nr;
2>	include the supportedBandCombinationList, featureSets and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra-nr:
2> if the UE supports (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a UE-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-MRDC-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra-nr;
3>	include the supportedBandCombinationList and featureSetCombinations as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to eutra:
2>	if the UE supports E-UTRA:
3>	include in the ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container of the type UE-EUTRA-Capability and with the rat-Type set to eutra as specified in TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3, according to the capabilityRequestFilter, if received;
1>	if the ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList contains a UE-CapabilityRAT-Request with rat-Type set to utra-fdd:
2>	if the UE supports UTRA-FDD:
3>	include the UE radio access capabilities for UTRA-FDD within a ue-CapabilityRAT-Container and with the rat-Type set to utra-fdd;
1>	if the RRC message segmentation is enabled based on the field rrc-SegAllowed received, and the encoded RRC message is larger than the maximum supported size of a PDCP SDU specified in TS 38.323 [5]:
2>	initiate the UL message segment transfer procedure as specified in clause 5.7.7;
1>	else:
2>	submit the UECapabilityInformation message to lower layers for transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
5.6.1.4	Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets supported by the UE
The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network requests UE capabilities for nr, eutra-nr or eutra. This procedure is invoked once per requested rat-Type (see clause 5.6.1.3 for capability enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries with the same fields with the same values, i.e. UE-CapabilityRequestFilterNR, UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon and fields in UECapabilityEnquiry message (i.e. requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC, requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only flag, and requestedCapabilityCommon) as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.
NOTE 1:	Capability enquiry without frequencyBandListFilter is not supported.
NOTE 2:	In (NG)EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types nr and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSets in the UE-NR-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types eutra and eutra-nr and it uses the featureSetsEUTRA in the UE-EUTRA-Capability together with the featureSetCombinations in the UE-MRDC-Capability to determine the E-UTRA UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used in the featureSets must match the IDs referred to in featureSetCombinations across all three containers. The requirement on consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set combinations.
NOTE 3:	If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.
The UE shall:
1>	compile a list of "candidate band combinations" according to the filter criteria in capabilityRequestFilterCommon (if included), only consisting of bands included in frequencyBandListFilter, and prioritized in the order of frequencyBandListFilter (i.e. first include band combinations containing the first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination, the parameters of the band do not exceed maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL, maxCarriersRequestedUL, ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
1>	for each band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations":
2>	if the network (E-UTRA) included the eutra-nr-only field, or
2>	if the requested rat-Type is eutra:
3>	remove the NR-only band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 4:	The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for nr but indicate with the eutra-nr-only flag that the UE shall not include any NR band combinations in the UE-NR-Capability. In this case the procedural text above removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets below.
2>	if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities of another band combination included in the list of "candidate band combinations", and
2>	if this fallback band combination is generated by releasing at least one SCell or uplink configuration of SCell or SUL according to TS 38.306 [26]:
3>	remove the band combination from the list of "candidate band combinations";
NOTE 5:	Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for nr, it may include E-UTRA band numbers in the frequencyBandListFilter to ensure that the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for subsequently requested eutra-nr capabilities. At this point of the procedure the list of "candidate band combinations" contains all NR- and/or E-UTRA-NR band combinations that match the filter (frequencyBandListFilter) provided by the NW and that match the eutra-nr-only flag (if RAT-Type nr is requested by E-UTRA). In the following, this candidate list is used to derive the band combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the requested capability container.
1>	if the requested rat-Type is nr:
2>	include into supportedBandCombinationList as many NR-only band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
3>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
4>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR for each band combination;
4>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
2>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;
2>	compile a list of "candidate feature set combinations" referenced from the list of "candidate band combinations" excluding entries (rows in feature set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
2>	if uplinkTxSwitchRequest is received:
3>	include into supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch as many NR-only band combinations that supported UL TX switching as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
4>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
5>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
6>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR for each band combination;
5>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
3>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch according to the previous;
NOTE 6:	This list of "candidate feature set combinations" contains the feature set combinations used for NR-only as well as E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to derive a list of NR feature sets referred to from the feature set combinations in the UE-NR-Capability and from the feature set combinations in a UE-MRDC-Capability container.
2>	if sidelinkRequest is received:
3>	for a sidelink band combination the UE included in supportedBandCombinationListSidelinkEUTRA-NR, supportedBandCombinationListSL-RelayDiscovery or supportedBandCombinationListSL-NonRelayDiscovery:
4>	if the UE supports partial sensing for a band of the sidelink band combination, include the partial sensing capabilities for the band using the sl-TransmissionMode2-PartialSensing-r17;
3>	set sidelinkRequested to true;
2>	include into featureSets the feature sets referenced from the "candidate feature set combinations" and may exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed any of maxBandwidthRequestedDL, maxBandwidthRequestedUL, maxCarriersRequestedDL or maxCarriersRequestedUL, whichever are received;
1>	else, if the requested rat-Type is eutra-nr:
2>	include into supportedBandCombinationList and/or supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
3>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
4>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR and srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA for each band combination;
4>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
2>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList according to the previous;
2>	if uplinkTxSwitchRequest is received:
3>	include into supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations that supported UL TX switching as possible from the list of "candidate band combinations", starting from the first entry;
4>	if srs-SwitchingTimeRequest is received:
5>	if SRS carrier switching is supported;
6>	include srs-SwitchingTimesListNR and srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA for each band combination;
5>	set srs-SwitchingTimeRequested to true;
3>	include, into featureSetCombinations, the feature set combinations referenced from the supported band combinations as included in supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch according to the previous;
1>	else (if the requested rat-Type is eutra):
2>	compile a list of "candidate feature set combinations" referenced from the list of "candidate band combinations" excluding entries (rows in feature set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
NOTE 7:	This list of "candidate feature set combinations" contains the feature set combinations used for E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the feature set combinations in a UE-MRDC-Capability container.
2>	include into featureSetsEUTRA (in the UE-EUTRA-Capability) the feature sets referenced from the "candidate feature set combinations" and may exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA or ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA, whichever are received;
1>	include the received frequencyBandListFilter in the field appliedFreqBandListFilter of the requested UE capability, except if the requested rat-Type is nr and the network included the eutra-nr-only field;
1>	if the network included ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt:
2>	include the received ue-CapabilityEnquiryExt in the field receivedFilters;

5.8	Sidelink
5.8.1	General
NR sidelink communication consists of unicast, groupcast and broadcast. For unicast, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of a Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS. The PC5-RRC signalling, as specified in clause 5.8.9, can be initiated after its corresponding PC5 unicast link establishment (TS 23.287 [55]). The PC5-RRC connection and the corresponding sidelink SRBs and sidelink DRB(s) are released when the PC5 unicast link is released as indicated by upper layers.
For each PC5-RRC connection of unicast, one sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB0) is used to transmit the PC5-S message(s) before the PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB1) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages to establish the PC5-S security. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB2) is used to transmit the PC5-S messages after the PC5-S security has been established, which is protected. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB3) is used to transmit the PC5-RRC signalling, which is protected and only sent after the PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB4) is used to transmit/receive the NR sidelink discovery messages.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, AS security comprises of integrity protection of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs), and it further comprises of ciphering of PC5 signaling (SL-SRB1 only for the Direct Link Security Mode Complete message as specified in TS 24.587 [57] for V2X service or TS 24.554 [72] for Proximity-services, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The ciphering and integrity protection algorithms and parameters for a PC5 unicast link are exchanged by PC5-S messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], and apply to the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], all messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-DRBs of the corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or ciphered by the PDCP.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or TS 24.554 [72], UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.
NOTE 1:	In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in SIB12 and sl-ConfigDedicatedNR within RRCReconfiguration used in clause 5.8 are provided by the configurations in SystemInformationBlockType28 and sl-ConfigDedicatedForNR within RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10], respectively.
NOTE 2:	In this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].
NOTE 3:	All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as specified in TS 33.536 [60].
NOTE 4:	When integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].
NOTE 5:	The selection of NULL algorithms means that the PC5 messages are considered protected for the purposes of being allowed to be sent or received.
5.8.2	Conditions for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation
The UE shall perform NR sidelink communication operation only if the conditions defined in this clause are met:
1>	if the UE's serving cell is suitable (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED); and if either the selected cell on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation belongs to the registered or equivalent PLMN as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or TS 24.554 [72] or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1>	if the UE's serving cell (RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) fulfils the conditions to support NR sidelink communication/discovery in limited service state as specified in TS 23.287 [55]; and if either the serving cell is on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation or the UE is out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1>	if the UE has no serving cell (RRC_IDLE).

The UE may initiate the sidelink RRC reconfiguration procedure and perform the operation in clause 5.8.9.1.2 on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in following cases:
-	the release of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
-	the establishment of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
-	the modification for the parameters included in SLRB-Config of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
-	the release of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.1;
-	the establishment of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.2;
-	the modification for the parameters included in SL-RLC-ChannelConfigPC5 of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.2;
-	the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement and report.
-	the (re-)configuration of the sidelink CSI reference signal resources and CSI reporting latency bound;
-	the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform sidelink DRX;

In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in RRCReconfiguration (if any). In RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in system information (if any). For other cases, UEs apply the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in SidelinkPreconfigNR (if any). When UE performs state transition between above three cases, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in the new state, after acquisition of the new configurations. Before acquisition of the new configurations, UE continues applying the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in the old state.

The purpose of this procedure is for a UE to inform its peer UE of the sidelink DRX assistance information used to determine the sidelink DRX configuration for unicast communication.
For sidelink unicast, a UE may include its desired sidelink DRX configurations in the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink as the sidelink DRX assistance information which is transmitted to its peer UE.
NOTE:	It is up to UE implementation to determine its desired sidelink DRX configurations for unicast communication.
5.8.9.6.2	Initiation
For sidelink unicast, if both a RX UE and its peer TX UE for a direction of sidelink communication are capable of sidelink DRX, the RX UE that is interested in sending the sidelink DRX assistance information may send the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink as the sidelink DRX assistance information to its peer UE when the sidelink DRX assistance information has not been sent previously or when the previously transmitted sidelink DRX assistance information has changed.
5.8.9.6.3	Actions related to reception of UEAssistanceInformationSidelink message
For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 1, it may report the sidelink DRX assistance information received within the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink from its peer UE to the network as specified in 5.8.3. For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with resource allocation mode 2 or is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or out of coverage, regardless of whether the UE has obtained the sidelink DRX assistance information from the UEAssistanceInformationSidelink transmitted from its peer UE or not, it may determine the sidelink DRX configuration SL-DRX-ConfigUC for its peer UE.
NOTE:	When UE determines the sidelink DRX configuration for its peer UE, it may take the sidelink DRX assistance information received from its peer UE into account.

5.8.10	Sidelink measurement
5.8.10.1	Introduction
The UE may configure the associated peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement and report on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in accordance with the NR sidelink measurement configuration for unicast by RRCReconfigurationSidelink message.
The NR sidelink measurement configuration includes the following parameters for a PC5-RRC connection:
1.	NR sidelink measurement objects: Object(s) on which the associated peer UE shall perform the NR sidelink measurements.
-	For NR sidelink measurement, a NR sidelink measurement object indicates the NR sidelink frequency of reference signals to be measured.
2.	NR sidelink reporting configurations: NR sidelink measurement reporting configuration(s) where there can be one or multiple NR sidelink reporting configurations per NR sidelink measurement object. Each NR sidelink reporting configuration consists of the following:
-	Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a NR sidelink measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event description.
-	RS type: The RS that the UE uses for NR sidelink measurement results. In this release, only DMRS is supported for NR sidelink measurement.
-	Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement report. In this release, only RSRP measurement is supported.
3.	NR sidelink measurement identities: A list of NR sidelink measurement identities where each NR sidelink measurement identity links one NR sidelink measurement object with one NR sidelink reporting configuration. By configuring multiple NR sidelink measurement identities, it is possible to link more than one NR sidelink measurement object to the same NR sidelink reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one NR sidelink reporting configuration to the same NR sidelink measurement object. The NR sidelink measurement identity is also included in the NR sidelink measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
4.	NR sidelink quantity configurations: The NR sidelink quantity configuration defines the NR sidelink measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting of that NR sidelink measurement. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured for different NR sidelink measurement quantities.
Both UEs of the PC5-RRC connection maintains a NR sidelink measurement object list, a NR sidelink reporting configuration list, and a NR sidelink measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this specification.

5.8.10.5	Sidelink measurement reporting
5.8.10.5.1	General

Figure 5.8.10.5.1-1: NR sidelink measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE to the peer UE associated.
For the sl-MeasId for which the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure was triggered, the UE shall set the sl-MeasResults within the MeasurementReportSidelink message as follows:
1>	set the sl-MeasId to the measurement identity that triggered the NR sidelink measurement reporting;
1>	if the sl-ReportConfig associated with the sl-MeasId that triggered the NR sidelink measurement reporting is set to sl-EventTriggered or sl-Periodical:

5.8.11	Zone identity calculation
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is located using the following formulae, if sl-ZoneConfig is configured:
x1= Floor (x / L) Mod 64;
y1= Floor (y / L) Mod 64;
Zone_id = y1 * 64 + x1.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
L is the value of sl-ZoneLength included in sl-ZoneConfig;
x is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is expressed in meters;
y is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE's current location and geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is expressed in meters.
NOTE:	How the calculated zone_id is used is specified in TS 38.321 [3].
5.8.12	DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN, the subframe number within a frame and slot number within a frame used for NR sidelink communication/discovery are derived from the current UTC time, by the following formulae:
DFN= Floor (0.1*(Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN)) mod 1024
SubframeNumber= Floor (Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN) mod 10
SlotNumber= Floor ((Tcurrent –Tref–OffsetDFN)*2μ) mod (10*2μ)
Where:
Tcurrent is the current UTC time obtained from GNSS. This value is expressed in milliseconds;
Tref is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday, January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
OffsetDFN is the value sl-OffsetDFN if configured, otherwise it is zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
μ=0/1/2/3 corresponding to the 15/30/60/120 kHz of SCS for SL, respectively.
NOTE 1:	In case of leap second change event, how UE obtains the scheduled time of leap second change to adjust Tcurrent correspondingly is left to UE implementation. How UE handles to avoid the sudden discontinuity of DFN is left to UE implementation.
NOTE 2:	Void.

5.9	MBS Broadcast
5.9.1	Introduction
5.9.1.1	General
UE receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) applies MBS broadcast procedures described in this clause as well as the MBS Interest Indication procedure as specified in clause 5.9.4.
MBS broadcast configuration information is provided on MCCH logical channel. MCCH carries the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message which indicates the MBS broadcast sessions that are provided in the cell as well as the corresponding scheduling related information for these sessions. Optionally, the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message may also contain a list of neighbour cells providing the same broadcast MBS service(s) as provided in the current cell. The configuration information required by the UE to receive MCCH is provided in SIB20. Additionally, System Information provides also an information related to service continuity of MBS broadcast in SIB21.
5.9.1.2	MCCH scheduling
The MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over MCCH) is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the common search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. If searchspaceMCCH is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for SIB1 where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in TS 38.213[13]. If searchspaceMCCH is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by searchspaceMCCH. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH transmission window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.
5.9.1.3	MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its scheduling (which is based on a repetition period).
When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs about the change starting from the beginning of the MCCH modification period via PDCCH which schedules the MCCH in every repetition in that modification period.
Upon receiving a change notification, a UE receiving or interested to receive MBS services transmitted using MBS broadcast acquires the new MCCH information starting from the same slot. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information. The notification is transmitted with a 2-bit bitmap, see TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1.5.1. The MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates the start of new MBS service(s). The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to '1', indicates modification of MCCH information other than the change caused by start of new MBS service(s), e.g. modification of a configuration of an on-going MBS session(s), MBS session(s) stop or neighbouring cell information modification.
5.9.2	MCCH information acquisition
5.9.2.1	General

Figure 5.9.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBS broadcast configuration information broadcasted by the network. The procedure applies to MBS capable UEs interested to receive or that are receiving MBS broadcast services that are in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceMCCH.
5.9.2.2	Initiation
A UE shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon becoming interested to receive MBS broadcast services. A UE interested to receive MBS broadcast services shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon entering the cell providing SIB20 (e.g. upon power on, following UE mobility), upon receiving SIB20 of an SCell via dedicated signalling and upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed due to the start of new MBS service(s). A UE that is receiving data via broadcast MRB shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed due to MCCH information modification other than the change caused by the start of new MBS service(s).
NOTE 1:	It is up to UE implementation how to address a possibility of the UE missing an MCCH change notification.
NOTE 2:	It is up to UE implementation to use the cell/tracking area list in the USD to avoid acquiring the MCCH when the UE is outside the MBS service area of the MBS broadcast service.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e. delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information.
5.9.2.3	MCCH information acquisition by the UE
An MBS capable UE interested to receive or receiving an MBS broadcast service shall:
1>	if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
2>	start acquiring the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message on MCCH in the concerned cell from the slot in which the change notification was received;
1>	if the UE enters a cell broadcasting SIB20; or
1>	if the UE receives sCellSIB20:
2>	acquire the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message on MCCH in the concerned cell at the next repetition period.
5.9.2.4	Actions upon reception of the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message
No UE requirements related to the contents of the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within the corresponding field descriptions.
5.9.3	Broadcast MRB configuration
5.9.3.1	General
The broadcast MRB configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure PDCP, RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive a broadcast MRB transmitted on MTCH, or upon modification of a configuration of a broadcast MRB received by the UE. The procedure applies to MBS capable UEs that are interested to receive or that are receiving an MBS broadcast service that are in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space configured by searchSpaceMTCH or searchSpaceMCCH.
NOTE:	How to perform a modification of a broadcast MRB which is already configured in the UE is left to UE implementation.
5.9.3.2	Initiation
The UE applies the broadcast MRB establishment procedure to start receiving an MBS session of an MBS broadcast service it is interested in. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon start of the MBS session, upon entering a cell providing an MBS broadcast service the UE is interested in, upon becoming interested in the ongoing MBS broadcast service, upon removal of the UE capability limitations inhibiting reception of the ongoing MBS broadcast service UE is interested in.
The UE applies the broadcast MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session of an MBS broadcast service. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of the MBS session, upon leaving the cell broadcasting the MBS service the UE is interested in, upon losing interest in the MBS service, when capability limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
5.9.3.3	Broadcast MRB establishment
Upon a broadcast MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1>	establish a PDCP entity and an RLC entity in accordance with MRB-InfoBroadcast for this broadcast MRB included in the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message and the configuration specified in 9.1.1.7;
1>	configure the MAC layer in accordance with the mtch-SchedulingInfo (if included);
1>	configure the physical layer in accordance with the mbs-SessionInfoList, searchSpaceMTCH, and pdsch-ConfigMTCH, applicable for the broadcast MRB;
1>	receive DL-SCH on the cell where the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message was received for the established broadcast MRB using g-RNTI and mtch-SchedulingInfo (if included) in this message for this MBS broadcast service;
1>	if an SDAP entity with the received mbs-SessionId does not exist:
2>	establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1.
2>	indicate the establishment of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers.
5.9.3.4	Broadcast MRB release
Upon broadcast MRB release for MBS broadcast service, the UE shall:
1>	release the PDCP entity, RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical layer configuration;
1>	if the SDAP entity associated with the corresponding mbs-SessionId has no associated MRB:
2>	release the SDAP entity, as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.2;
2>	indicate the release of the user plane resources for the mbs-SessionId to upper layers.
5.9.4	MBS Interest Indication
5.9.4.1	General

Figure 5.9.4.1-1: MBS Interest Indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE in RRC_CONNECTED is receiving or is interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) and to inform the network about the priority of MBS broadcast versus unicast and multicast MRB reception. MBS Interest Indication can only be sent after AS security activation.
5.9.4.2	Initiation
An MBS capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases including upon successful connection establishment/resume, upon entering or leaving the broadcast service area, upon MBS broadcast session start or stop, upon change of interest, upon change of priority between MBS broadcast reception and unicast/multicast reception, upon change to a PCell providing SIB21 (i.e. where the SIB1 scheduling information contains SIB21), upon receiving SIB20 of an SCell via dedicated signalling, upon handover, and upon RRC connection re-establishment.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1>	if SIB21 is provided by the PCell:
2>	ensure having a valid version of SIB21 for the PCell;
2>	if the UE did not transmit MBS Interest Indication since last entering RRC_CONNECTED state; or
2>	if since the last time the UE transmitted an MBS Interest Indication, the UE connected to a PCell not providing SIB21:
3>	if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.9.4.3, is not empty:
4>	set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate transmission of the MBSInterestIndication message;
2>	else:
3>	if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with 5.9.4.3, is different from mbs-FreqList included in the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication; or
3>	if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBS broadcast frequencies compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers and multicast MRBs has changed since the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication:
4>	set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate transmission of the MBSInterestIndication message;
NOTE:	The UE may send MBS Interest Indication even when it is able to receive the MBS services it is interested in, i.e. to avoid that the network allocates a configuration inhibiting MBS broadcast reception.
3>	else if SIB20 is provided for the PCell or for the SCell:
4>	if since the last time the UE transmitted the MBS Interest Indication, the UE connected to a PCell not providing SIB20 and the UE was not provided with SIB20 for an SCell; or
4>	if the set of MBS broadcast services of interest determined in accordance with 5.9.4.4 is different from mbs-ServiceList included in the last transmission of the MBS Interest Indication:
5>	set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and initiate the transmission of MBSInterestIndication message.
5.9.4.3	MBS frequencies of interest determination
The UE shall:
1>	consider a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of interest if the following conditions are met:
2>	at least one MBS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via a broadcast MRB is ongoing or about to start; and
NOTE 1:	The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 38.300 [2] or TS 23.247 [67].
2>	for at least one of these MBS sessions, SIB21 acquired from the PCell includes mapping between the concerned frequency and one or more MBS FSAIs indicated in the USD for this session, or for at least one of these MBS sessions, the concerned frequency is not included in SIB21 but is indicated in the USD for this session; and
NOTE 2:	The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of interest even though NG-RAN may (temporarily) not employ a broadcast MRB for the concerned session, i.e., the UE does not verify if the session is indicated on MCCH.
2>	the supportedBandCombinationList the UE included in UE-NR-Capability contains at least one band combination including the concerned MBS frequency.
NOTE 3:	When evaluating which frequencies the UE is capable of receiving, the UE does not take into account whether they are currently configured as serving frequencies.
5.9.4.4	MBS services of interest determination
The UE shall:
1>	consider an MBS service to be part of the MBS services of interest if the following conditions are met:

2>	include mbs-FreqList and set it to include the MBS frequencies of interest sorted by decreasing order of interest, using the absoluteFrequencySSB for serving frequency, if applicable, and the ARFCN-ValueNR(s) as included in SIB21 or in USD (for neighbouring frequencies);
2>	include mbs-Priority if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated MBS frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers and multicast MRBs;
NOTE 1:	If the UE prioritises MBS broadcast reception and unicast/multicast data cannot be supported because of congestion on the MBS carrier(s), NG-RAN may for example initiate release of unicast bearers/multicast MRBs.

6	Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
6.1	General
6.1.1	Introduction
The contents of each RRC message is specified in clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract types is further specified in a similar manner in clause 6.3.
Usage of the text "Network always configures the UE with a value for this field" in the field description indicates that the network has to provide a value for the field in this or in a previous message based on delta configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not imply a mandatory presence of the field.
6.1.2	Need codes and conditions for optional fields
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1), is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the downlink direction for RRC message and in the sidelink for PC5 RRC message. The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.
If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the message or information element specifying the need of the field for each condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may expect regarding the setting of the message by the network for the RRC message or by the peer UE in the sidelink RRC message. Violation of conditions is regarded as invalid network behaviour when transmitting downlink RRC message or invalid UE behavior when transmitting PC5 RRC message, which the UE is not required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the CondC or CondM condition.
For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.
Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to be present
Abbreviation
Meaning
Cond conditionTag
Conditionally present
Presence of the field is specified in a tabular form following the ASN.1 segment.
CondC conditionTag
Configuration condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other configuration settings.
CondM conditionTag
Message condition
Presence of the field is conditional to other fields included in the message.
Need S
Specified
Used for (configuration) fields, whose field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior performed upon receiving a message with the field absent (and not if field description or procedure specifies the UE behavior when field is not configured).
Need M
Maintain
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE maintains the current value.
Need N
No action (one-shot configuration that is not maintained)
Used for (configuration) fields that are not stored and whose presence causes a one-time action by the UE. Upon receiving message with the field absent, the UE takes no action.
Need R
Release
Used for (configuration) fields that are stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon receiving a message with the field absent, the UE releases the current value.
NOTE:	In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM are not used.
Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as Need R.
The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX definition may contain the following "otherwise the field is absent" parts:
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent": The field is not relevant or should not be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the condition).
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R": The field is released if absent when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the condition applies (which means that network when transmitting downlink RRC message or peer UE transmitting PC5 RRC message can assume UE releases the field if this part of the condition is valid).
-	"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M": The UE retains the field if it was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the network when transmitting downlink RRC message or the peer UE when transmitting PC5 RRC message cannot release the field, but UE retains the previously configured value.
Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be avoided.
For downlink RRC message and sidelink PC5 RRC messages, the need codes, conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present. Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the absence of the parent field implies that.
For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink RRC messages or sidelink PC5 RRC message, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink RRC messages and sidelink PC5 RRC message without need codes where this rule applies are:
-	nonCriticalExtension fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE extension mechanism,
-	groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as extension groups), and
-	non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent extension fields).
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.

    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE does not modify any child fields configured within field1 (regardless of their need codes);
-	if field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is absent, UE releases the field2 (and also its child field field21);
-	if field1 or field2 in RRCMessage-IEs is present, UE retains or releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
-	if field1 in RRCMessage-IEs is present but the extension group containing field13 and field14 is absent, the UE releases field13 but does not modify field14;
-	if nonCriticalExtension defined by IE RRCMessage-v1570-IEs is absent, the UE does not modify field3 but releases field4;
6.1.3	General rules
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.
Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure, the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the UE configuration before applying the received list and shall consider each entry as newly created. This applies also to lists whose size is extended (i.e. with a second list structure in the ASN.1 comprising additional entries), unless otherwise specified. This implies that Need M should not be used for fields in the entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such fields equivalent to a Need R.

segmentNumber
Identifies the sequence number of a segment within the encoded DL DCCH message. The network transmits the segments with continuously increasing segmentNumber order so that the UE's RRC layer may expect to obtain them from lower layers in the correct order. Hence, the UE is not required to perform segment re-ordering on RRC level.
rrc-MessageSegmentContainer
Includes a segment of the encoded DL DCCH message. The size of the included segment in this container should be small enough so the resulting encoded RRC message PDU is less than or equal to the PDCP SDU size limit.
rrc-MessageSegmentType
Indicates whether the included DL DCCH message segment is the last segment of the message or not.

List of neighbour cells providing one or more MBS broadcast services via broadcast MRB that are provided by the current cell. This field is used by the UE together with mtch-NeighbourCell field signalled for each MBS session in the corresponding MBS-SessionInfo. When an empty mbs-NeighbourCellList list is signalled, the UE shall assume that MBS broadcast services signalled in mbs-SessionInfoList in the MBSBroadcastConfiguration message are not provided in any neighbour cell. When a non-empty mbs-NeighbourCellList is signalled, the current serving cell does not provide information about MBS broadcast services of a neighbour cell that is not included in mbs-NeighbourCellList, i.e., the UE cannot determine the presence or absence of an MBS service of a neighbour cell that is absent. When the field mbs-NeighbourCellList is absent, the current serving cell does not provide information about MBS broadcast services in the neighbouring cells, i.e. the UE cannot determine the presence or absence of an MBS service in neighbouring cells based on the absence of this field.

MIB field descriptions
cellBarred
Value barred means that the cell is barred, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. This field is ignored for connectivity to NTN.
dmrs-TypeA-Position
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.2) and uplink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
intraFreqReselection
Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells when the highest ranked cell is barred, or treated as barred by the UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT.
pdcch-ConfigSIB1
Determines a common ControlResourceSet (CORESET), a common search space and necessary PDCCH parameters. If the field ssb-SubcarrierOffset indicates that SIB1 is absent, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 indicates the frequency positions where the UE may find SS/PBCH block with SIB1 or the frequency range where the network does not provide SS/PBCH block with SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
ssb-SubcarrierOffset
Corresponds to kSSB (see TS 38.213 [13]), which is the frequency domain offset between SSB and the overall resource block grid in number of subcarriers. (See TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1). For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 (see 37.213 [48]), this field corresponds to , and kSSB is obtained from  (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.3.1); the LSB of this field is used also for deriving the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
The value range of this field may be extended by an additional most significant bit encoded within PBCH as specified in TS 38.213 [13].
This field may indicate that this cell does not provide SIB1 and that there is hence no CORESET#0 configured in MIB (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). In this case, the field pdcch-ConfigSIB1 may indicate the frequency positions where the UE may (not) find a SS/PBCH with a control resource set and search space for SIB1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 13).
subCarrierSpacingCommon
Subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, paging and broadcast SI-messages. If the UE acquires this MIB on an FR1 carrier frequency, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 15 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 30 kHz. If the UE acquires this MIB on an FR2 carrier frequency, the value scs15or60 corresponds to 60 kHz and the value scs30or120 corresponds to 120 kHz. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1 (see 37.213 [48]) and for operation in FR2-2, the subcarrier spacing for SIB1, Msg.2/4 and MsgB for initial access, paging and broadcast SI-messages is same as that for the corresponding SSB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access, this field instead is used for deriving the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
systemFrameNumber
The 6 most significant bits (MSB) of the 10-bit System Frame Number (SFN). The 4 LSB of the SFN are conveyed in the PBCH transport block as part of channel coding (i.e. outside the MIB encoding), as defined in clause 7.1 in TS 38.212 [17].

The field is absent if any DAPS bearer is configured or if the masterCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync or if the sl-L2RemoteUE-Config or sl-L2RelayUE-Config is configured. For conditional PSCell change, the field is absent if the secondaryCellGroup includes ReconfigurationWithSync. The RRCReconfiguration message contained in DLInformationTransferMRDC cannot contain the field conditionalReconfiguration for conditional PSCell change or for conditional PSCell addition.
daps-SourceRelease
Indicates to UE that the source cell part of DAPS operation is to be stopped and the source cell part of DAPS configuration is to be released.
dedicatedNAS-MessageList
This field is used to transfer UE specific NAS layer information between the network and the UE. The RRC layer is transparent for each PDU in the list. 
dedicatedPagingDelivery
This field is used to transfer Paging message for the associated L2 U2N Remote UE to the L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED.
dedicatedPosSysInfoDelivery
This field is used to transfer SIBPos to the UE in RRC_CONNECTED.
dedicatedSIB1-Delivery
This field is used to transfer SIB1 to the UE (including L2 U2N Remote UE). The field has the same values as the corresponding configuration in servingCellConfigCommon.
dedicatedSystemInformationDelivery
This field is used to transfer SIB6, SIB7, SIB8, SIB19, SIB21 to the UE with an active BWP with no common search space configured or the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED. For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED (including L2 U2N Remote UE), this field is also used to transfer the SIBs requested on-demand.
defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID
This field is used for IAB-node to configure the default uplink Routing ID, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IAB-MT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BAP-RoutingID can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes. This field is mandatory only for IAB-node bootstrapping.
defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel
This field is used for IAB-nodes to configure the default uplink BH RLC channel, which is used by IAB-node during IAB-node bootstrapping, migration, IAB-MT RRC resume and IAB-MT RRC re-establishment for F1-C and non-F1 traffic. The defaultUL-BH-RLC-Channel can be (re-)configured when IAB-node IP address for F1-C related traffic changes, and the new IP address is anchored at a different IAB-donor-DU. This field is mandatory for IAB-node bootstrapping. If the IAB-MT is operating in EN-DC, the default uplink BH RLC channel is referring to an RLC channel on the SCG; Otherwise, it is referring to an RLC channel either on the MCG or on the SCG depending on whether the MN or the SN configures this field.

Configuration of secondary cell group ((NG)EN-DC or NR-DC).
sk-Counter
A counter used upon initial configuration of S-KgNB or S-KeNB, as well as upon refresh of S-KgNB or S-KeNB. This field is always included either upon initial configuration of an NR SCG or upon configuration of the first RB with keyToUse set to secondary, whichever happens first. This field is absent if there is neither any NR SCG nor any RB with keyToUse set to secondary.
sl-ConfigDedicatedNR
This field is used to provide the dedicated configurations for NR sidelink communication/discovery.
sl-ConfigDedicatedEUTRA-Info
This field includes the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration as specified in TS 36.331 [10]. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration can only includes sidelink related fields for V2X sidelink communication, i.e. sl-V2X-ConfigDedicated, sl-V2X-SPS-Config, measConfig and/or otherConfig.

targetCellSMTC-SCG
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell addition and SN change. When UE receives this field, UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of NR PCell for PSCell addition and PSCell change for the case of no reconfiguration with sync of MCG, and UE applies the configuration based on the timing reference of target NR PCell for the case of reconfiguration with sync of MCG. If both this field and the smtc in secondaryCellGroup -> SpCellConfig -> reconfigurationWithSync are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.
t316

ue-TxTEG-RequestUL-TDOA-Config
Configures the periodicity of UE reporting for the association between Tx TEG and SRS Positioning resources. When configured with oneShot UE reports the association only one time. When configured with periodicReporting UE reports the association periodically and the periodicReporting indicates the periodicity. Value ms160 corresponds to 160ms, value ms320 corresponds to 320ms and so on.
ul-GapFR2-Config
Indicates the FR2 UL gap configuration to UE. In EN-DC and NGEN-DC, the SN decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern. In NE-DC, the MN decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern. In NR-DC without FR2-FR2 band combination, the network entity which is configured with FR2 serving cell(s) decides and configures the FR2 UL gap pattern.

SIB1 field descriptions
cellBarredNTN
Value barred means that the cell is barred for connectivity to NTN, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. Value notBarred means that the cell is allowed for connectivity to NTN. If not present, the UE considers the cell is not allowed for connectivity to NTN, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is only applicable to NTN-capable UEs.
cellBarredRedCap1Rx
Value barred means that the cell is barred for a RedCap UE with 1 Rx branch, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by non-RedCap UEs.
cellBarredRedCap2Rx
Value barred means that the cell is barred for a RedCap UE with 2 Rx branches, as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. This field is ignored by non-RedCap UEs.
cellSelectionInfo
Parameters for cell selection related to the serving cell.
eCallOverIMS-Support
Indicates whether the cell supports eCall over IMS services as defined in TS 23.501 [32]. If absent, eCall over IMS is not supported by the network in the cell.
eDRX-AllowedIdle
The presence of this field indicates that extended DRX for CN paging is allowed in the cell for UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. The UE shall stop using extended DRX for CN paging in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE if eDRX-AllowedIdle is not present.
eDRX-AllowedInactive
The presence of this field indicates that extended DRX for RAN paging is allowed in the cell for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE. The UE shall stop using extended DRX for RAN paging in RRC_INACTIVE if eDRX-AllowedInactive is not present.
featurePriorities
Indicates priorities for features, such as RedCap, Slicing, SDT and MSG3-Repetitions for Coverage Enhancements. These priorities are used to determine which FeatureCombinationPreambles the UE shall use when a feature maps to more than one FeatureCombinationPreambles, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. A lower value means a higher priority. The network does not signal the same priority for more than one feature. The network signals a priority for all feature that map to at least one FeatureCombinationPreambles.
halfDuplexRedCap-Allowed
The presence of this field indicates that the cell supports half-duplex FDD RedCap UEs.
hsdn-Cell
This field indicates this is a HSDN cell as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
hyperSFN
Indicates hyper SFN which increments by one when the SFN wraps around. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of hyper SFN should not result in system information change notifications.
idleModeMeasurementsEUTRA
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for EUTRA idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform EUTRA idle/inactive measurements.
idleModeMeasurementsNR
This field indicates that a UE that is configured for NR idle/inactive measurements shall perform the measurements while camping in this cell and report availability of these measurements when establishing or resuming a connection in this cell. If absent, a UE is not required to perform NR idle/inactive measurements.
ims-EmergencySupport
Indicates whether the cell supports IMS emergency bearer services for UEs in limited service mode. If absent, IMS emergency call is not supported by the network in the cell for UEs in limited service mode.
intraFreqReselectionRedCap
Controls cell selection/reselection to intra-frequency cells for RedCap UEs when this cell is barred, or treated as barred by the RedCap UE, as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. If not present, a RedCap UE treats the cell as barred, i.e.,the UE considers that the cell does not support RedCap.
q-QualMin
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.  
q-QualMinOffset
Parameter "Qqualminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qqualminoffset = field value [dB]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for Qqualminoffset. Affects the minimum required quality level in the cell.
q-RxLevMin
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
q-RxLevMinOffset
Parameter "Qrxlevminoffset" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qrxlevminoffset = field value * 2 [dB]. If absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for Qrxlevminoffset. Affects the minimum required Rx level in the cell.
q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for serving cell.
sdt-RSRP-Threshold
RSRP threshold used to determine whether SDT procedure can be initiated, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
sdt-DataVolumeThreshold
Data volume threshold used to determine whether SDT can be initiated, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value byte32 corresponds to 32 bytes, value byte100 corresponds to 100 bytes, and so on.
sdt-LogicalChannelSR-DelayTimer
The value of logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer applied during SDT for logical channels configured with SDT, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value in number of subframes. Value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, sf40 corresponds to 40 subframes, and so on. If this field is not configured, then logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer is not applied for SDT logical channels.
servingCellConfigCommon
Configuration of the serving cell.
t319a
Initial value of the timer T319a used for detection of SDT failure. Value ms100 corresponds to 100 milliseconds, value ms200 corresponds to 200 milliseconds and so on.
uac-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo
Information used to determine whether Access Category 1 applies to the UE, as defined in TS 22.261 [25]. If plmnCommon is chosen, the UAC-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo is applicable to all the PLMNs and SNPNs in plmn-IdentityInfoList and npn-IdentityInfoList. If individualPLMNList is chosen, the 1st entry in the list corresponds to the first network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList, the 2nd entry in the list corresponds to the second network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList and so on. If uac-AC1-SelectAssistInfo-r16 is present, the UE shall ignore the uac-AccessCategory1-SelectionAssistanceInfo.
uac-AC1-SelectAssistInfo
Information used to determine whether Access Category 1 applies to the UE, as defined in TS 22.261 [25]. The 1st entry in the list corresponds to the first network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and npn-IdentityInfoList, the 2nd entry in the list corresponds to the second network within all of the PLMNs and SNPNs across the plmn-IdentityList and the npn-IdentityInfoList and so on. Value notConfigured indicates that Access Category1 is not configured for the corresponding PLMN/SNPN.
uac-BarringForCommon
Common access control parameters for each access category. Common values are used for all PLMNs/SNPNs, unless overwritten by the PLMN/SNPN specific configuration provided in uac-BarringPerPLMN-List. The parameters are specified by providing an index to the set of configurations (uac-BarringInfoSetList). UE behaviour upon absence of this field is specified in clause 5.3.14.2.
ue-TimersAndConstants
Timer and constant values to be used by the UE. The cell operating as PCell always provides this field.
useFullResumeID
Indicates which resume identifier and Resume request message should be used. UE uses fullI-RNTI and RRCResumeRequest1 if the field is present, or shortI-RNTI and RRCResumeRequest if the field is absent.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
EDRX-RC
The field is optionally present, Need R, in a cell that enables eDRX-AllowedIdle, otherwise it is absent.

This field is used to provide information on random access attempts. This field is mandatory present.
raPurpose
This field is used to indicate the RA scenario for which the RA report entry is triggered. The RA accesses associated to Initial access from RRC_IDLE, RRC re-establishment procedure, transition from RRC-INACTIVE. The indicator beamFailureRecovery is used in case of successful beam failure recovery related RA procedure in the SpCell [3]. The indicator reconfigurationWithSync is used if the UE executes a reconfiguration with sync. The indicator ulUnSynchronized is used if the random access procedure is initiated in a SpCell by DL or UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED when the timeAlignmentTimer is not running in the PTAG or if the RA procedure is initiated in a serving cell by a PDCCH order [3]. The indicator schedulingRequestFailure is used in case of SR failures [3]. The indicator noPUCCHResourceAvailable is used when the UE has no valid SR PUCCH resources configured [3]. The indicator requestForOtherSI is used for MSG1 based on demand SI request. The indicator msg3RequestForOtherSI is used in case of MSG3 based SI request. The field can also be used for the SCG-related RA-Report when the raPurpose is set to beamFailureRecovery, reconfigurationWithSync, ulUnSynchronized, schedulingRequestFailure and noPUCCHResourceAvailable.
spCellID
This field is used to indicate the CGI of the SpCell of the cell group associated to the SCell in which the associated random access procedure was performed.

Information common for non-intra-frequency cell re-selection i.e. cell re-selection to inter-frequency and inter-RAT cells.
combineRelaxedMeasCondition
When both lowMobilityEvalutation and cellEdgeEvalutation criteria are present in SIB2, this parameter configures the UE to fulfil both criteria in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection. If the field is absent, the UE is allowed to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection when either or both of the criteria are met. (See TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0)
combineRelaxedMeasCondition2
When both stationaryMobilityEvaluation and cellEdgeEvaluationWhileStationary criteria are present in SIB2, this parameter configures the UE to fulfil both criteria in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection. If the field is absent, the UE is allowed to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection when only the stationary criteria is met. (See TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0)
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
This field indicates whether the UE can utilize serving cell timing to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the serving frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
frequencyBandList
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR cell reselection parameters apply. The UE behaviour in case the field is absent is described in clause 5.2.2.4.3.

If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. The IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
q-Hyst
Parameter "Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20], Value in dB. Value dB1 corresponds to 1 dB, dB2 corresponds to 2 dB and so on.
q-HystSF
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for Qhyst" in TS 38.304 [20]. The sf-Medium and sf-High concern the additional hysteresis to be applied, in Medium and High Mobility state respectively, to Qhyst as defined in TS 38.304 [20]. In dB. Value dB-6 corresponds to -6dB, dB-4 corresponds to -4dB and so on.
q-QualMin
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.  
q-RxLevMin
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells.
q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20], applicable for intra-frequency neighbour cells.
rangeToBestCell
Parameter "rangeToBestCell" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures only non-negative (in dB) values.
relaxedMeasurement
Configuration to allow relaxation of RRM measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9). In NTN, this field is only applicable for GSO neighbour cells.
s-IntraSearchP
Parameter "SIntraSearchP" in TS 38.304 [20].
s-IntraSearchQ
Parameter "SIntraSearchQ" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for SIntraSearchQ.
s-NonIntraSearchP
Parameter "SnonIntraSearchP" in TS 38.304 [20]. If this field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of infinity for SnonIntraSearchP.
s-NonIntraSearchQ
Parameter "SnonIntraSearchQ" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of 0 dB for SnonIntraSearchQ.

s-SearchThresholdP, s-SearchThresholdP2
Parameters "SSearchThresholdP" and "SSearchThresholdP2" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures s-SearchThresholdP and s-SearchThresholdP2 to be less than or equal to s-IntraSearchP and s-NonIntraSearchP.
s-SearchThresholdQ, s-SearchThresholdQ2
Parameters "SSearchThresholdQ" and "SSearchThresholdQ2" in TS 38.304 [20]. The network configures s-SearchThresholdQ and s-SearchThresholdQ2 to be less than or equal to s-IntraSearchQ and s-NonIntraSearchQ.
smtc
Measurement timing configuration for intra-frequency measurement. If this field is absent, the UE assumes that SSB periodicity is 5 ms for the intra-frequnecy cells. If the field is broadcast by an NTN cell, the offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) is based on the assumption that service link propagation delay difference between the serving cell and neighbour cells equals to 0 ms, and UE can adjust the actual offset based on the actual propagation delay difference.
smtc2-LP
Measurement timing configuration for intra-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity (LP) indicated by periodicity in smtc2-LP. The timing offset and duration are equal to the offset and duration indicated in smtc in intraFreqCellReselectionInfo. The periodicity in smtc2-LP can only be set to a value strictly larger than the periodicity in smtc in intraFreqCellReselectionInfo (e.g. if smtc indicates sf20 the Long Periodicity can only be set to sf40, sf80 or sf160, if smtc indicates sf160, smtc2-LP cannot be configured). The pci-List, if present, includes the physical cell identities of the intra-frequency neighbour cells with Long Periodicity. If smtc2-LP is absent, the UE assumes that there are no intra-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity.
smtc4list
Measurement timing configuration list for NTN deployments, see clause 5.5.2.10. The offset of each SSB-MTC4 in smtc4list is based on the assumption that service link propagation delay difference between the serving cell and neighbour cells equals to 0 ms, and UE can adjust the actual offset based on the actual propagation delay difference. For a UE that supports less SMTCs than what is included in this list, it is up to the UE to select which SMTCs to consider.
ssb-PositionQCL-Common
Indicates the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks for intra-frequency neighbor cells as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent the UE measures on all SS-blocks.
stationaryMobilityEvaluation
Indicates the criteria for a UE to detect stationary mobility, in order to relax measurement requirements for cell reselection (see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.9.0).
t-ReselectionNR
Parameter "TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20].
t-ReselectionNR-SF
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE behaviour is specified in TS 38.304 [20].
threshServingLowP
Parameter "ThreshServing, LowP" in TS 38.304 [20].
threshServingLowQ
Parameter "ThreshServing, LowQ" in TS 38.304 [20].

SIB4 field descriptions
absThreshSS-BlocksConsolidation
Threshold for consolidation of L1 measurements per RS index. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
channelAccessMode2
If present, this field indicates that the neighbor cells on the inter-frequency apply channel access mode procedures for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4 for FR2-2. If absent, the neighbor cells on the inter-frequency do not apply any channel access procedure.
deriveSSB-IndexFromCell
This field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency. If this field is set to true, the UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment across cells on the neighbor frequency as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
dl-CarrierFreq
This field indicates center frequency of the SS block of the neighbour cells, where the frequency corresponds to a GSCN value as specified in TS 38.101-1 [15].
frequencyBandList
Indicates the list of frequency bands for which the NR cell reselection parameters apply.
highSpeedMeasInterFreq
If the field is set to true and UE supports high speed inter-frequency IDLE/INACTIVE measurements, the UE shall apply the enhanced inter-frequency RRM requirements on the inter-frequency carrier to support high speed up to 500 km/h in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE as specified in TS 38.133 [14].
interFreqAllowedCellList
List of allow-listed inter-frequency neighbouring cells, see TS 38.304 [20], clause 5.2.4.
interFreqCAG-CellList
List of inter-frequency neighbouring CAG cells (as defined in TS 38.304 [20] per PLMN.
interFreqCarrierFreqList
List of neighbouring carrier frequencies and frequency specific cell re-selection information. If interFreqCarrierFreqList-v1610, interFreqCarrierFreqList-v1700, interFreqCarrierFreqList-v1720 or interFreqCarrierFreqList-v1730 are present, they shall contain the same number of entries, listed in the same order as in interFreqCarrierFreqList (without suffix).
interFreqExcludedCellList
List of exclude-listed inter-frequency neighbouring cells.
interFreqNeighCellList
List of inter-frequency neighbouring cells with specific cell re-selection parameters. If interFreqNeighCellList-v1610 is present, it shall contain the same number of entries, listed in the same order as in interFreqNeighCellList (without suffix).
interFreqNeighHSDN-CellList
List of inter-frequency neighbouring HSDN cells as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
nrofSS-BlocksToAverage
Number of SS blocks to average for cell measurement derivation. If the field is absent, the UE uses the measurement quantity as specified in TS 38.304 [20].
p-Max
Value in dBm applicable for the neighbouring NR cells on this carrier frequency. If absent the UE applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-1 [15] in case of an FR1 cell or TS 38.101-2 [39] in case of an FR2 cell. In this release of the specification, if p-Max is present on a carrier frequency in FR2, the UE shall ignore the field and applies the maximum power according to TS 38.101-2 [39]. This field is ignored by IAB-MT. The IAB-MT applies output power and emissions requirements, as specified in TS 38.174 [63].
q-OffsetCell
Parameter "Qoffsets,n" in TS 38.304 [20].
q-OffsetFreq
Parameter "Qoffsetfrequency" in TS 38.304 [20].
q-QualMin
Parameter "Qqualmin" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE applies the (default) value of negative infinity for Qqualmin.
q-QualMinOffsetCell
Parameter "Qqualminoffsetcell" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qqualminoffsetcell = field value [dB].
q-RxLevMin
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20].
q-RxLevMinOffsetCell
Parameter "Qrxlevminoffsetcell" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value Qrxlevminoffsetcell = field value * 2 [dB].
q-RxLevMinOffsetCellSUL
Parameter "QrxlevminoffsetcellSUL" in TS 38.304 [20]. Actual value QrxlevminoffsetcellSUL = field value * 2 [dB].
q-RxLevMinSUL
Parameter "Qrxlevmin" in TS 38.304 [20].
redCapAccessAllowed
Indicates whether RedCap UEs are allowed to access the frequency.
smtc
Measurement timing configuration for inter-frequency measurement. If this field is absent, the UE assumes that SSB periodicity is 5 ms in this frequency. If the field is broadcast by an NTN cell, the offset (derived from parameter periodicityAndOffset) is based on the assumption that service link propagation delay difference between the serving cell and neighbour cells equals to 0 ms, and UE can adjust the actual offset based on the actual propagation delay difference.
smtc2-LP
Measurement timing configuration for inter-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity (LP) indicated by periodicity in smtc2-LP. The timing offset and duration are equal to the offset and duration indicated in smtc in InterFreqCarrierFreqInfo. The periodicity in smtc2-LP can only be set to a value strictly larger than the periodicity in smtc in InterFreqCarrierFreqInfo (e.g. if smtc indicates sf20 the Long Periodicity can only be set to sf40, sf80 or sf160, if smtc indicates sf160, smtc2-LP cannot be configured). The pci-List, if present, includes the physical cell identities of the inter-frequency neighbour cells with Long Periodicity. If smtc2-LP is absent, the UE assumes that there are no inter-frequency neighbour cells with a Long Periodicity.
smtc4list
Measurement timing configuration list for NTN deployments, see clause 5.5.2.10. The offset of each SSB-MTC4 in smtc4list is based on the assumption that service link propagation delay difference between the serving cell and neighbour cells equals to 0 ms, and UE can adjust the actual offset based on the actual propagation delay difference. For a UE that supports less SMTCs than what is included in this list, it is up to the UE to select which SMTCs to consider.
ssb-PositionQCL
Indicates the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks for a specific neighbor cell as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. If provided, the cell specific value overwrites the common value signalled by ssb-PositionQCL-Common in SIB4 for the indicated cell.
ssb-PositionQCL-Common
Indicates the QCL relation between SS/PBCH blocks for inter-frequency neighbor cells as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is absent the UE measures on all SS-blocks.
ssbSubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of SSB.
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:    15 or 30 kHz
FR2-1:  120 or 240 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
threshX-HighP
Parameter "ThreshX, HighP" in TS 38.304 [20].
threshX-HighQ
Parameter "ThreshX, HighQ" in TS 38.304 [20].
threshX-LowP
Parameter "ThreshX, LowP" in TS 38.304 [20].
threshX-LowQ
Parameter "ThreshX, LowQ" in TS 38.304 [20].
t-ReselectionNR
Parameter "TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20].
t-ReselectionNR-SF
Parameter "Speed dependent ScalingFactor for TreselectionNR" in TS 38.304 [20]. If the field is absent, the UE behaviour is specified in TS 38.304 [20].

Offset between UTC and local time in units of 15 minutes. Actual value = field value * 15 minutes. Local time of the day is calculated as UTC time + localTimeOffset.
timeInfoUTC
Coordinated Universal Time corresponding to the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted. The field counts the number of UTC seconds in 10 ms units since 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 (midnight between Sunday, December 31, 1899 and Monday, January 1, 1900). See NOTE 1. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of timeInfoUTC should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.

NOTE 1:	The UE may use this field together with the leapSeconds field to obtain GPS time as follows: GPS Time (in seconds) = timeInfoUTC (in seconds) -  2,524,953,600 (seconds) + leapSeconds, where 2,524,953,600 is the number of seconds between 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1 January, 1900 and 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time).

This field indicates whether the included segment is the last segment or not.
trs-ResourceSetConfig
RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive UE(s), in terms of a list of N>=1 NZP TRS resource set(s). The maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is 64. If a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability indication is always enabled based on that configuration. A UE which acquired SIB17 with a TRS configuration but did not yet receive an associated L1-based availability indication considers the configured TRS as unavailable. If SIB scheduling indicates that SIB17 has changed, the UE considers its configured TRS(s) as unavailable until it receives the associated L1-based availability indication(s).
validityDuration
The valid time duration for L1 availability indication, time unit is one default paging cycle. When the field is absent, UE assumes a default time duration to be 2 default paging cycles. The field is only valid while the UE has a valid SIB17.

PosSI-SchedulingInfo field descriptions
areaScope
Indicates that a posSIB is area specific. If the field is absent, the posSIB is cell specific.
encrypted
The presence of this field indicates that the pos-sib-type is encrypted as specified in TS 37.355 [49].
gnss-id
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific GNSS. Indicates a specific GNSS (see also TS 37.355 [49])
posSI-BroadcastStatus
Indicates if the SI message is being broadcasted or not. Change of posSI-BroadcastStatus should not result in system information change notifications in Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). The value of the indication is valid until the end of the BCCH modification period when set to broadcasting.
If si-SchedulingInfo-v1700 is present, the network ensures that the total number of SI messages with posSI-BroadcastStatus and si-BroadcastStatus set to notBroadcasting in the concatenated list of SI messages configured by posSchedulingInfoList in posSI-SchedulingInfo and SI messages containing type2 SIB configured by schedulingInfoList2 in si-SchedulingInfo-v1700 does not exceed the limit of maxSI-Message when posSI-RequestConfig or posSI-RequestConfigRedCap or posSI-RequestConfigSUL is configured.
posSI-RequestConfig
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
posSI-RequestConfigRedCap
Configuration of Msg1 resources for initialUplinkBWP-RedCap that the RedCap UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
posSI-RequestConfigSUL
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which posSI-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
posSIB-MappingInfo
List of the posSIBs mapped to this SystemInformation message.
posSibType
The positioning SIB type is defined in TS 37.355 [49].
posSI-Periodicity
Periodicity of the SI-message in radio frames, such that rf8 denotes 8 radio frames, rf16 denotes 16 radio frames, and so on. If the offsetToSI-Used is configured, the posSI-Periodicity of rf8 cannot be used.
offsetToSI-Used
This field, if present indicates that all the SI messages in posSchedulingInfoList are scheduled with an offset of 8 radio frames compared to SI messages in schedulingInfoList. offsetToSI-Used may be present only if the shortest configured SI message periodicity for SI messages in schedulingInfoList is 80ms. If SI offset is used, this field is present in each of the SI messages in the posSchedulingInfoList.
sbas-id
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific SBAS. Indicates a specific SBAS (see also TS 37.355 [49]).

Conditional presence
Explanation
GNSS-ID-SBAS
The field is mandatory present if gnss-id is set to sbas. It is absent otherwise.

Set of reference signals (CSI-RS and/or SSB) identifying the candidate beams for recovery and the associated RA parameters. This set includes all elements of candidateBeamRSList (without suffix) and all elements of candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610. The UE maintains candidateBeamRSList and candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 separately: Receiving candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 set to release releases only the entries that were configured by candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610, and receiving candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 set to setup replaces only the entries that were configured by candidateBeamRSListExt-v1610 with the newly signalled entries. The network configures these reference signals to be within the linked DL BWP (i.e., within the DL BWP with the same bwp-Id) of the UL BWP in which the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig is provided. 
msg1-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing for contention free beam failure recovery (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2).

BWP field descriptions
cyclicPrefix
Indicates whether to use the extended cyclic prefix for this bandwidth part. If not set, the UE uses the normal cyclic prefix. Normal CP is supported for all subcarrier spacings and slot formats. Extended CP is supported only for 60 kHz subcarrier spacing. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.2). Except for SUL, the network ensures the same cyclic prefix length is used in active DL BWP and active UL BWP within a serving cell.
locationAndBandwidth
Frequency domain location and bandwidth of this bandwidth part. The value of the field shall be interpreted as resource indicator value (RIV) as defined TS 38.214 [19] with assumptions as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 12, i.e. setting =275. The first PRB is a PRB determined by subcarrierSpacing of this BWP and offsetToCarrier (configured in SCS-SpecificCarrier contained within FrequencyInfoDL / FrequencyInfoUL / FrequencyInfoUL-SIB / FrequencyInfoDL-SIB within ServingCellConfigCommon / ServingCellConfigCommonSIB) corresponding to this subcarrier spacing. In case of TDD, a BWP-pair (UL BWP and DL BWP with the same bwp-Id) must have the same center frequency (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 12)
subcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing to be used in this BWP for all channels and reference signals unless explicitly configured elsewhere. Corresponds to subcarrier spacing according to TS 38.211 [16], table 4.2-1. The value kHz15 corresponds to µ=0, value kHz30 corresponds to µ=1, and so on.
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:    15, 30, or 60 kHz
FR2-1:  60 or 120 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
For the initial DL BWP and operation in licensed spectrum this field has the same value as the field subCarrierSpacingCommon in MIB of the same serving cell. Except for SUL, the network ensures the same subcarrier spacing is used in active DL BWP and active UL BWP within a serving cell. For the initial DL BWP and operation with shared spectrum channel access, the value of this field corresponds to the subcarrier spacing of the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP.

BWP-DownlinkDedicated field descriptions
beamFailureRecoverySCellConfig
Configuration of candidate RS for beam failure recovery on SCells.
beamFailureRecoverySpCellConfig
Configuration of candidate RS for beam failure recovery on the SpCell. This field can only be configured when beamFailure-r17 is configured in RadioLinkMonitoringConfig.
cfr-ConfigMulticast
UE specific common frequency resource configuration for MBS multicast for one dedicated BWP. This field can be configured within at most one serving cell.
dl-PPW-PreConfigToAddModList
Indicates a list of DL-PRS processing window configurations to be added or modified for the dedicated DL BWP.
dl-PPW-PreConfigToReleaseList
Indicates a list of DL-PRS processing window configurations to be released for the dedicated DL BWP.
harq-FeedbackEnablingforSPSactive
If enabled, UE reports ACK/NACK for the first SPS PDSCH after activation, regardless of if HARQ feedback is enabled or disabled corresponding to the first SPS PDSCH after activation. Otherwise, UE follows configuration of HARQ feedback enabled/disabled corresponding to the first SPS PDSCH after activation.
nonCellDefiningSSB
If configured, the RedCap UE operating in this BWP uses this SSB for the purposes for which it would otherwise have used the CD-SSB of the serving cell (e.g. obtaining sync, measurements, RLM). Furthermore, other parts of the BWP configuration that refer to an SSB (e.g. the "SSB" configured in the QCL-Info IE; the "ssb-Index" configured in the RadioLinkMonitoringRS; CFRA-SSB-Resource; PRACH-ResourceDedicatedBFR) refer implicitily to this NCD-SSB.
The NCD-SSB has the same values for the properties (e.g., ssb-PositionsInBurst, PCI, ssb-periodicity, ssb-PBCH-BlockPower) of the corresponding CD-SSB apart from the values of the properties configured in the NonCellDefiningSSB-r17 IE.
pdcch-Config
UE specific PDCCH configuration for one BWP.
pdsch-Config
UE specific PDSCH configuration for one BWP.
preConfGapStatus
Indicates whether the pre-configured measurement gaps (i.e. the gaps configured with preConfigInd) are activated or deactivated upon the switch to this BWP. If this field is configured, the UE shall apply network-controlled mechanism for activation and deactivation of the pre-configured measurement gaps, otherwise the UE shall apply the autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism, as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to the measurement gap with gap ID 1, the second bit corresponds to measurement gap with gap ID 2, and so on. Value 0 indicates that the corresponding pre-configured measurement gap is deactivated while value 1 indicates that the corresponding pre-configured measurement gap is activated. The UE shall ignore the bit if the corresponding measurement gap is not a pre-configured measurement gap.
servingCellMO
measObjectId of the MeasObjectNR in MeasConfig which is associated to the serving cell. For this MeasObjectNR, the following relationship applies between this MeasObjectNR and nonCellDefiningSSB in BWP-DownlinkDedicated of the associated downlink BWP: if ssbFrequency is configured, its value is the same as the absoluteFrequencySSB in the nonCellDefiningSSB. If the field is present in a downlink BWP and the BWP is activated, the RedCap UE uses this measurement object for serving cell measurements (e.g., including those used in measurement report triggering events), otherwise, the RedCap UE uses the servingCellMO in ServingCellConfig IE.
sps-Config
UE specific SPS (Semi-Persistent Scheduling) configuration for one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure sps-Config when there is an active configured downlink assignment (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the sps-Config at any time. Network can only configure SPS in one BWP using either this field or sps-ConfigToAddModList.
sps-ConfigDeactivationStateList
Indicates a list of the deactivation states in which each state can be mapped to a single or multiple SPS configurations to be deactivated, see clause 10.2 in TS 38.213 [13]. If a state is mapped to multiple SPS configurations, each of these SPS configurations is configured with the same harq-CodebookID.
sps-ConfigToAddModList
Indicates a list of one or more DL SPS configurations to be added or modified in one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure a SPS configuration when it is active (see TS 38.321 [3]).
sps-ConfigToReleaseList
Indicates a list of one or more DL SPS configurations to be released. The NW may release a SPS configuration at any time.
radioLinkMonitoringConfig
UE specific configuration of radio link monitoring for detecting cell- and beam radio link failure occasions. The maximum number of failure detection resources should be limited up to 8 for both cell and beam radio link failure detection. For SCells, only periodic 1-port CSI-RS can be configured in IE RadioLinkMonitoringConfig.
sl-PDCCH-Config
Indicates the UE specific PDCCH configurations for receiving the SL grants (via SL-RNTI or SL-CS-RNTI) for NR sidelink communication/discovery.
sl-V2X-PDCCH-Config
Indicates the UE specific PDCCH configurations for receiving SL grants (i.e. sidelink SPS) for V2X sidelink communication.

BWP-UplinkCommon field descriptions
additionalRACH-ConfigList
List of feature or feature combination-specific RACH configurations, i.e. the RACH configurations configured in addition to the one configured by rach-ConfigCommon and by msgA-ConfigCommon. The network associates all possible preambles of an additional RACH configuration to one or more feature(s) or feature combination(s). The network does not configure this list to have more than 16 entries. If both rach-ConfigCommon and msgA-ConfigCommon are configured for a specific FeatureCombination, the network always provides them in the same additionalRACH-Config.
enableRA-PrioritizationForSlicing
Indicates whether or not the ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep should override the ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity. The field is applicable only when the UE is configured by upper layers with both NSAG and Access Identity 1 or 2. If value TRUE is configured, the UE should only apply the ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep. If value FALSE is configured, the UE should only apply ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity. If the field is absent, whether to use ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep or ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity is up to UE implementation.
mcs-Msg3-Repetitions
Configuration of eight candidate MCS indexes for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant and DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. Only the first 4 configured or default MCS indexes are used for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant. This field is only applicable when the UE selects Random Access resources indicating Msg3 repetition in this BWP. If this field is absent when the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP-UplinkCommon, the UE shall apply the values {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7} (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.4).
msgA-ConfigCommon
Configuration of the cell specific PRACH and PUSCH resource parameters for transmission of MsgA in 2-step random access type procedure. The NW can configure msgA-ConfigCommon only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP or for RedCap UEs DL BWPs associated with nonCellDefiningSSB or the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP.
numberOfMsg3-RepetitionsList
The number of repetitions for PUSCH transmission scheduled by RAR UL grant and DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This field is only applicable when the UE selects Random Access resources indicating Msg3 repetition in this BWP. If this field is absent when the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP-UplinkCommon, the UE shall apply the values {n1, n2, n3, n4} (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1).
pucch-ConfigCommon
Cell specific parameters for the PUCCH of this BWP. 
pusch-ConfigCommon
Cell specific parameters for the PUSCH of this BWP.
rach-ConfigCommon
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters which the UE uses for contention based and contention free random access as well as for contention based beam failure recovery in this BWP. The NW configures SSB-based RA (and hence RACH-ConfigCommon) only for UL BWPs if the linked DL BWPs (same bwp-Id as UL-BWP) are the initial DL BWPs or DL BWPs containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP or for RedCap UEs DL BWPs associated with nonCellDefiningSSB or the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP. The network configures rach-ConfigCommon, whenever it configures contention free random access (for reconfiguration with sync or for beam failure recovery). For RedCap-specific initial uplink BWP, rach-ConfigCommon is always configured when msgA-ConfigCommon is configured in this BWP.
rach-ConfigCommonIAB
Configuration of cell specific random access parameters for the IAB-MT. The IAB specific IAB RACH configuration is used by IAB-MT, if configured.
rsrp-ThresholdMsg3
Threshold used by the UE for determining whether to select resources indicating Msg3 repetition in this BWP, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The field is mandatory if both set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication and set(s) of Random Access resources without MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP. It is absent otherwise.
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH
If the field is present, the UE uses uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for cell-specific PUSCH, e.g., PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant (see TS 38.213 [13] clause 8.3 and TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.2) and uses interlaced PUCCH Format 0 and 1 for cell-specific PUCCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1).

Conditional Presence
Explanation
Msg3Rep
This field is optionally present, Need S, if the set(s) of Random Access resources with MSG3 repetition indication are configured in the BWP-UplinkCommon. It is absent otherwise.
RA-PrioSliceAI
The field is optionally present in SIB1, Need R, if both parameters ra-PrioritizationForAccessIdentity and the ra-PrioritizationForSlicing/ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep are present in SIB1. It is absent otherwise.

BWP-UplinkDedicated field descriptions
beamFailureRecoveryConfig
Configuration of beam failure recovery. If supplementaryUplink is present, the field is present only in one of the uplink carriers, either UL or SUL.
configuredGrantConfig
A Configured-Grant of type1 or type2. It may be configured for UL or SUL but in case of type1 not for both at a time. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure configuredGrantConfig when there is an active configured uplink grant Type 2 (see TS 38.321 [3]). However, the NW may release the configuredGrantConfig at any time. Network can only configure configured grant in one BWP using either this field or configuredGrantConfigToAddModList.
configuredGrantConfigToAddModList
Indicates a list of one or more configured grant configurations to be added or modified for one BWP. Except for reconfiguration with sync, the NW does not reconfigure a Type 2 configured grant configuration when it is active (see TS 38.321 [3]). The network configures multiple CG configurations for one BWP with either all configurations or no configuration configured with cg-RetransmissionTimer-r16.
configuredGrantConfigToReleaseList
Indicates a list of one or more UL Configured Grant configurations to be released. The NW may release a configured grant configuration at any time.
configuredGrantConfigType2DeactivationStateList
Indicates a list of the deactivation states in which each state can be mapped to a single or multiple Configured Grant type 2 configurations to be deactivated when the corresponding deactivation DCI is received, see clause 7.3.1 in TS 38.212 [17] and clause 10.2 in TS 38.213 [13].
cp-ExtensionC2, cp-ExtensionC3
Configures the cyclic prefix (CP) extension (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.1). For 15 kHz SCS, {1..28} are valid for both cp-ExtensionC2 and cp-ExtensionC3. For 30 kHz SCS, {1..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC2 and {2..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC3. For 60 kHz SCS, {2..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC2 and {3..28} are valid for cp-ExtensionC3.
lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig
Configures parameters used for detection of consistent uplink LBT failures for operation with shared spectrum channel access, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
pathlossReferenceRSToAddModList
A list of Reference Signals (e.g. a CSI-RS config or a SS block) to be used for path loss estimation for PUSCH, PUCCH and SRS for unified TCI state operation. If unifiedTCI-StateType is not configured for the serving cell, no element in this list is configured.
pucch-Config
PUCCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL, the network configures PUCCH only on the BWPs of one of the uplinks (normal UL or SUL). The network configures PUCCH-Config at least on non-initial BWP(s) for SpCell and on all BPW(s) for PUCCH SCell. If supported by the UE, the network may configure at most one additional SCell of a cell group with PUCCH-Config (i.e. PUCCH SCell). If PUCCH cell switching is supported by the UE, the network may configure two TDD serving cells with PUCCH-Config within each PUCCH group. For supporting PUCCH cell switching in the PUCCH group with the SpCell, the TDD SpCell and one TDD SCell shall have PUCCH-Config on their normal UL. For supporting PUCCH cell switching in the PUCCH group with only SCells, two TDD SCells shall have PUCCH-Config on their normal UL.
In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, the NW configures at most one serving cell per frequency range with PUCCH. In (NG)EN-DC and NE-DC, if two PUCCH groups are configured, the serving cells of the NR PUCCH group in FR2 use the same numerology. For NR-DC, the maximum number of PUCCH groups in each cell group is one, and only the same numerology is supported for the cell group with carriers only in FR2.
The NW may configure PUCCH for a BWP when setting up the BWP. The network may also add/remove the pucch-Config in an RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync (for SpCell or PUCCH SCell) or with SCell release and add (for PUCCH SCell) to move the PUCCH between the UL and SUL carrier of one serving cell. In other cases, only modifications of a previously configured pucch-Config are allowed.
If one (S)UL BWP of a serving cell is configured with PUCCH, all other (S)UL BWPs must be configured with PUCCH, too.
pucch-ConfigurationList
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1). Different PUCCH Resource IDs are configured in different PUCCH-Config within the pucch-ConfigurationList if configured.
pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast1
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed HARQ-ACK codebooks for MBS multicast (see TS 38.213, clause 9).
pucch-ConfigurationListMulticast2
PUCCH configurations for two simultaneously constructed NACK-only feedback for MBS multicast (see TS 38.213, clause 9).
pusch-Config
PUSCH configuration for one BWP of the normal UL or SUL of a serving cell. If the UE is configured with SUL and if it has a PUSCH-Config for both UL and SUL, an UL/SUL indicator field in DCI indicates which of the two to use. See TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1.
pucch-ConfigMulticast1
PUCCH configuration for the HARQ-ACK codebook for MBS multicast when multicast feedback is not configured with a priority value (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9). If the field is not configured, pucch-Config applies.
pucch-ConfigMulticast2
PUCCH configuration for the NACK-only feedback for MBS multicast when multicast feedback is not configured with a priority value (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9). If the field is not configured, pucch-Config applies.
sl-PUCCH-Config
Indicates the UE specific PUCCH configurations used for the HARQ-ACK feedback reporting for NR sidelink communication.
srs-Config
Uplink sounding reference signal configuration.
ul-powerControl
Configures power control parameters for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS when UE is configured with unifiedTCI-StateType for this serving cell. For each serving cell, ul-powerControl is either configured in all BWP-UplinkDedicated or it is not configured in any BWP-UplinkDedicated. When unifiedTCI-StateRef in the BWP-UplinkDedicated of a serving cell refers to another serving cell, ul-powerControl is either configured in all BWP-UplinkDedicated of these two serving cells or it is not configured in any BWP-UplinkDedicated of these two serving cells.
ul-TCI-StateList
Indicates the applicable UL TCI states for PUCCH, PUSCH and SRS.
ul-TCI-ToAddModList
Indicates a list of UL TCI states.
unifiedTCI-StateRef
Provides the serving cell and UL BWP where UL TCI states applicable to this UL BWP are defined.
useInterlacePUCCH-PUSCH
If the field is present, the UE uses uplink frequency domain resource allocation Type 2 for PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.3 and TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.2) and uses interlaced PUCCH Format 0, 1, 2, and 3 for PUCCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1).

Conditional Presence
Explanation
NoTCI-PC
The field is optionally present, Need R, if unifiedTCI-StateType is configured for this serving cell and ul-powerControl is not configured for any UL TCI state or joint TCI state of this serving cell. Otherwise it is absent, Need R
SpCellOnly
The field is optionally present, Need M, in the BWP-UplinkDedicated of an SpCell. It is absent otherwise. 

NOTE 1:	In case of RRCReconfiguration with reconfigurationWithSync, the UE performs a MAC reset, which involves releasing the PUCCH-CSI/SRS/SR configuration in accordance with clause 5.3.12 and TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.12 and 5.2. Hence, for these parts of the dedicated radio resource configuration, delta signalling is not supported in the message when reconfigurationWithSync is included.

rlc-BearerToAddModList
Configuration of the MAC Logical Channel, the corresponding RLC entities and association with radio bearers.
reportUplinkTxDirectCurrent
Enables reporting of uplink and supplementary uplink Direct Current location information upon BWP configuration and reconfiguration. This field is only present when the BWP configuration is modified or any serving cell is added or removed. This field is absent in the IE CellGroupConfig when provided as part of RRCSetup message. If UE is configured with SUL carrier, UE reports both UL and SUL Direct Current locations.
reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentMoreCarrier
Enables reporting of uplink Direct Current location information when the UE is configured with intra-band CA. This field is absent in the IE CellGroupConfig when provided as part of RRCSetup message. The UE only reports the uplink Direct Current location information that are related to the indicated cc-CombinationList. The network does not include carriers which locate in DL only spectrum described in TS 38.101-2 [39], clause 5.3A.4 and defined by Fsd according to Table 5.3A.4-3 in FR2 in the IntraBandCC-CombinationReqList. I.e. DL-only carrier in FR2 frequency spectrum is not used to calculate the default DC location.
reportUplinkTxDirectCurrentTwoCarrier
Enables reporting of uplink Direct Current location information when the UE is configured with uplink intra-band CA with two carriers. This field is absent in the IE CellGroupConfig when provided as part of RRCSetup message.
rlc-BearerToReleaseListExt
List of the RLC entities and the corresponding MAC Logical Channels to be released for multicast MRBs.
rlmInSyncOutOfSyncThreshold
BLER threshold pair index for IS/OOS indication generation, see TS 38.133 [14], table 8.1.1-1. n1 corresponds to the value 1. When the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0. Whenever this is reconfigured, UE resets N310 and N311, and stops T310, if running. Network does not include this field.
sCellSIB20
This field is used to transfer SIB20 of the SCell in order to allow the UE for MBS broadcast reception on SCell. The network configures this field only for a single SCell at a time.
sCellState
Indicates whether the SCell shall be considered to be in activated state upon SCell configuration. If the field is included for an SCell configured with TRS for fast activation of the SCell, such TRS is not used for the corresponding SCell.
sCellToAddModList
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be added or modified.
sCellToReleaseList
List of secondary serving cells (SCells) to be released.
secondaryDRX-GroupConfig
The field is used to indicate whether the SCell belongs to the secondary DRX group. All serving cells in the secondary DRX group shall belong to one Frequency Range and all serving cells in the legacy DRX group shall belong to another Frequency Range.
simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1, simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2
List of serving cells which can be updated simultaneously for spatial relation with a MAC CE. The simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList1 and simultaneousSpatial-UpdatedList2 shall not contain same serving cells. Network should not configure serving cells that are configured with a BWP with two different values for the coresetPoolIndex in these lists.
simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1, simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2
List of serving cells which can be updated simultaneously for TCI relation with a MAC CE. The simultaneousTCI-UpdateList1 and simultaneousTCI-UpdateList2 shall not contain same serving cells. Network should not configure serving cells that are configured with a BWP with two different values for the coresetPoolIndex in these lists.
simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList1, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList2, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList3, simultaneousU-TCI-UpdateList4
List of serving cells for which the Unified TCI States Activation/Deactivation MAC CE applies simultaneously, as specified in TS 38.321 [3] clause 6.1.3.47. The different lists shall not contain same serving cells. Network only configures in these lists serving cells that are configured with unifiedTCI-StateType.
spCellConfig
Parameters for the SpCell of this cell group (PCell of MCG or PSCell of SCG). 
uplinkTxSwitchingOption
Indicates which option is configured for dynamic UL Tx switching for inter-band UL CA or (NG)EN-DC. The field is set to switchedUL if network configures option 1 as specified in TS 38.214 [19], or dualUL if network configures option 2 as specified in TS 38.214 [19]. Network always configures UE with a value for this field in inter-band UL CA case and (NG)EN-DC case where UE supports dynamic UL Tx switching.
uplinkTxSwitchingPowerBoosting
Indicates whether the UE is allowed to enable 3dB boosting on the maximum output power for transmission on carrier2 under the operation state in which 2-port transmission can be supported on carrier2 for inter-band UL CA case with dynamic UL Tx switching as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15]. Network can only configure this field for dynamic UL Tx switching in inter-band UL CA case with power Class 3 as defined in TS 38.101-1 [15].
uplinkTxSwitching-2T-Mode
Indicates 2Tx-2Tx switching mode is configured for inter-band UL CA or SUL, in which the switching gap duration for a triggered uplink switching (as specified in TS 38.214 [19]) is equal to the switching time capability value reported for the switching mode.
If this field is absent and uplinkTxSwitching is configured, it is interpreted that 1Tx-2Tx UL Tx switching is configured as specified in TS 38.214 [19]. In this case, there is one uplink (or one uplink band in case of intra-band) configured with uplinkTxSwitching, on which the maximum number of antenna ports among all configured P-SRS/A-SRS and activated SP-SRS resources should be 1 and non-codebook based UL MIMO is not configured.
uplinkTxSwitching-DualUL-TxState
Indicates the state of Tx chains if the state of Tx chains after the UL Tx switching is not unique (as specified in TS 38.214 [19]) in case of 2Tx-2Tx switching is configured and uplinkTxSwitchingOption is set to dualUL. Value oneT indicates 1Tx is assumed to be supported on the carriers on each band, value twoT indicates 2Tx is assumed to be supported on that carrier.
uu-RelayRLC-ChannelToAddModList
List of the Uu RLC entities and the corresponding MAC Logical Channels to be added or modified.
uu-RelayRLC-ChannelToReleaseList
List of the Uu RLC entities and the corresponding MAC Logical Channels to be released.

DeactivatedSCG-Config field descriptions
bfd-and-RLM
If the field is set to true, the UE shall perform RLM and BFD on the PSCell when the SCG is deactivated and the network ensures that beamFailure-r17 is not configured in the radioLinkMonitoringConfig of the DL BWP of the PSCell in which the UE performs BFD. If set to false, the UE is not required to perform RLM and BFD on the PSCell when the SCG is deactivated.

DAPS-UplinkPowerConfig field descriptions
p-DAPS-Source
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the source cell group during DAPS handover.
p-DAPS-Target
The maximum total transmit power to be used by the UE in the target cell group during DAPS handover.

ReconfigurationWithSync field descriptions
rach-ConfigDedicated
Random access configuration to be used for the reconfiguration with sync (e.g. handover). The UE performs the RA according to these parameters in the firstActiveUplinkBWP (see UplinkConfig).
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR PSCell change and NR PCell change. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in spCellConfigCommon or sets to the same periodicity as ssb-Periodicity-r17 in nonCellDefiningSSB-r17 if the first active DL BWP included in this RRC message is configured with nonCellDefiningSSB-r17 for RedCap.
For case of NR PCell change, the smtc is based on the timing reference of (source) PCell. For case of NR PSCell change, it is based on the timing reference of source PSCell.
If both this field and targetCellSMTC-SCG are absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message. For a RedCap UE, if the first active DL BWP included in this RRC message is configured with nonCellDefiningSSB-r17, this field corresponds to the NCD-SSB indicated by nonCellDefiningSSB-r17, otherwise, this field corresponds to the CD-SSB indicated by absoluteFrequencySSB in frequencyInfoDL.

Indicates whether the pre-configured measurement gaps (i.e. the gaps configured with preConfigInd) are activated or deactivated while this SCell is deactivated. If this field is configured, the UE shall apply network-controlled mechanism for activation and deactivation of the pre-configured measurement gaps, otherwise the UE shall apply the autonomous activation/deactivation mechanism, as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to the measurement gap with gap ID 1, the second bit corresponds to measurement gap with gap ID 2, and so on. Value 0 indicates that the corresponding pre-configured measurement gap is deactivated while value 1 indicates that the corresponding pre-configured measurement gap is activated. The UE shall ignore the bit if the corresponding measurement gap is not a pre-configured measurement gap.
smtc
The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for NR SCell addition. The network sets the periodicityAndOffset to indicate the same periodicity as ssb-periodicityServingCell in sCellConfigCommon. The smtc is based on the timing of the SpCell of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in the measObjectNR having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message.

CondReconfigToAddMod field descriptions
condExecutionCond
The execution condition that needs to be fulfilled in order to trigger the execution of a conditional reconfiguration for CHO, CPA, intra-SN CPC without MN involvement or MN initiated inter-SN CPC. When configuring 2 triggering events (Meas Ids) for a candidate cell, the network ensures that both refer to the same measObject. For CHO, if the network configures condEventD1 or condEventT1 for a candidate cell, the network configures a second triggering event condEventA3, condEventA4 or condEventA5 for the same candidate cell. The network does not configure both condEventD1 and condEventT1 for the same candidate cell. For CHO in terrestrial networks, the network does not indicate a MeasId associated with condEventA4. For CPA and for MN-initiated inter-SN CPC, the network only indicates MeasId(s) associated with condEventA4. For intra-SN CPC, the network only indicates MeasId(s) associated with condEventA3 or condEventA5.
condExecutionCondSCG
Contains execution condition that needs to be fulfilled in order to trigger the execution of a conditional reconfiguration for SN initiated inter-SN CPC. The Meas Ids refer to the measConfig associated with the SCG. When configuring 2 triggering events (Meas Ids) for a candidate cell, network ensures that both refer to the same measObject. For each condReconfigId, the network always configures either condExecutionCond or condExecutionCondSCG (not both). The network only indicates MeasId(s) associated with condEventA3 or condEventA5.
condRRCReconfig
The RRCReconfiguration message to be applied when the condition(s) are fulfilled. The RRCReconfiguration message contained in condRRCReconfig cannot contain the field conditionalReconfiguration or the field daps-Config.

ControlResourceSet field descriptions
cce-REG-MappingType
Mapping of Control Channel Elements (CCE) to Resource Element Groups (REG) (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
controlResourceSetId
Identifies the instance of the ControlResourceSet IE. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon (controlResourceSetZero) and is hence not used here in the ControlResourceSet IE. Other values identify CORESETs configured by dedicated signalling or in SIB1 or SIB20. The controlResourceSetId is unique among the BWPs of a serving cell.
If the field controlResourceSetId-v1610 is present, the UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId field (without suffix).
coresetPoolIndex
The index of the CORESET pool for this CORESET as specified in TS 38.213 [13] (clauses 9 and 10) and TS 38.214 [19] (clauses 5.1 and 6.1). If the field is absent, the UE applies the value 0.
duration
Contiguous time duration of the CORESET in number of symbols (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
followUnifiedTCI-State
When set to enabled, for PDCCH reception on this CORESET, the UE applies the "indicated" DL only TCI or joint TCI as specified in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5.
frequencyDomainResources
Frequency domain resources for the CORESET. Each bit corresponds a group of 6 RBs, with grouping starting from the first RB group in the BWP or MBS CFR where the CORESET is configured. When at least one search space is configured with freqMonitorLocation-r16, only the first  bits are valid (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). The first (left-most / most significant) bit corresponds to the first RB group in the BWP or MBS CFR where the CORESET is configured, and so on. A bit that is set to 1 indicates that this RB group belongs to the frequency domain resource of this CORESET. Bits corresponding to a group of RBs not fully contained in the bandwidth part within which the CORESET is configured are set to zero (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
interleaverSize
Interleaver-size (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
pdcch-DMRS-ScramblingID
PDCCH DMRS scrambling initialization (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.3.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellId configured for this serving cell.
precoderGranularity
Precoder granularity in frequency domain (see TS 38.211 [16], clauses 7.3.2.2 and 7.4.1.3.2).
rb-Offset
Indicates the RB level offset in units of RB from the first RB of the first 6RB group to the first RB of BWP (see 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
reg-BundleSize
Resource Element Groups (REGs) can be bundled to create REG bundles. This parameter defines the size of such bundles (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
shiftIndex
When the field is absent the UE applies the value of the physCellIdconfigured for this serving cell (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.3.2.2).
tci-PresentInDCI
This field indicates if TCI field is present or absent in DCI format 1_1 and DCI format 4_2. When the field is absent the UE considers the TCI to be absent/disabled. In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network sets this field to enabled for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_1 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
tci-PresentDCI-1-2
Configures the number of bits for "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format 1_2. When the field is absent the UE applies the value of 0 bit for the "Transmission configuration indicator" in DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5). In case of cross carrier scheduling, the network configures this field for the ControlResourceSet used for cross carrier scheduling in DCI format 1_2 in the scheduling cell if enableDefaultBeamForCCS is not configured (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5).
tci-StatesPDCCH-ToAddList
A subset of the TCI states defined in pdsch-Config, either with tci-StatesToAddModList or dl-OrJointTCI-StateList, included in the BWP-DownlinkDedicated corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the ControlResourceSet belong to. They are used for providing QCL relationships between the DL RS(s) in one RS Set (TCI-State) and the PDCCH DMRS ports (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.). The network configures at most maxNrofTCI-StatesPDCCH entries. The QCL relationships defined herein do not apply to MBS broadcast.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
NotSIB-initialBWP
The field is absent in SIB1/SIB20 and in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP in ServingCellConfigCommon, if SIB1/SIB20 is broadcasted. Otherwise, it is optionally present, Need N.

–	ControlResourceSetId
The ControlResourceSetId IE concerns a short identity, used to identify a control resource set within a serving cell. The ControlResourceSetId = 0 identifies the ControlResourceSet#0 configured via PBCH (MIB) and in controlResourceSetZero (ServingCellConfigCommon). The ID space is used across the BWPs and MBS CFRs of a Serving Cell.

CrossCarrierSchedulingConfig field descriptions
carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-0-2, carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-1-2
Configures the number of bits for the field of carrier indicator in PDCCH DCI format 0_2/1_2. The field carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-0-2 refers to DCI format 0_2 and the field carrierIndicatorSizeDCI-1-2 refers to DCI format 1_2, respectively (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
ccs-BlindDetectionSplit
Indicates the share of blind detection candidates and non-overlapping CCEs for PDCCH monitoring on an SpCell and an SCell when cross-carrier scheduling is configured from the SCell for the SpCell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1.1). The network only configures this field when it sets the field other for an SpCell, i.e., when it configures cross-carrier scheduling of the SpCell by a PDCCH on an Scell.
cif-Presence
The field is used to indicate whether carrier indicator field is present (value true) or not (value false) in PDCCH DCI formats, see TS 38.213 [13]. If cif-Presence is set to true, the CIF value indicating a grant or assignment for this cell is 0.
cif-InSchedulingCell
The field indicates the CIF value used in the scheduling cell to indicate a grant or assignment applicable for this cell, see TS 38.213 [13]. If configured for an SpCell, the non-fallback DCI formats on the SpCell include same number of CIF bits as the corresponding non-fallback DCI formats on the scheduling cell, and the CIF bits are considered reserved.
enableDefaultBeamForCCS
This field indicates whether default beam selection for cross-carrier scheduled PDSCH is enabled, see TS 38.214 [19]. If not present, the default beam selection behaviour is not applied, i.e. Rel-15 behaviour is applied. This field can only be configured in the cross-scheduled SCell or SpCell.
other
Parameters for cross-carrier scheduling. If configured for an SpCell, the SpCell can be scheduled by the PDCCH on another SCell as well as by the PDCCH on the SpCell. If configured for an SCell, the SCell is scheduled by a PDDCH on another cell.
own
Parameters for self-scheduling, i.e., a serving cell is scheduled by its own PDCCH.
schedulingCellId
If configured for an SpCell, this field indicates which SCell, in addition to the SpCell, signals the downlink allocations and uplink grants, if applicable, for the concerned SpCell. If configured for an Scell, this field indicates which cell signals the downlink allocations and uplink grants, if applicable, for the concerned SCell. In case the UE is configured with DC, the scheduling cell is part of the same cell group (i.e. MCG or SCG) as the scheduled cell. In case the UE is configured with two PUCCH groups, the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell are within the same PUCCH group. If drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup is configured in the MAC-CellGroupConfig associated with this serving cell, the scheduling cell and the scheduled cell belong to the same Frequency Range. In addition, the serving cell with an aperiodic CSI trigger and the PUSCH resource scheduled for the report are on the same carrier and serving cell, but the cell for which CSI is reported may belong to the same or a different Frequency Range. The network should not trigger a CSI request for a serving cell in the other Frequency Range when that serving cell is outside Active Time.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CIF-PRESENCE
The field is mandatory present if the cif-Presence is set to true. The field is absent otherwise.

–	CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList
The CSI-AperiodicTriggerStateList IE is used to configure the UE with a list of aperiodic trigger states. Each codepoint of the DCI field "CSI request" is associated with one trigger state (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 6.1.3.13). Upon reception of the value associated with a trigger state, the UE will perform measurement of CSI-RS, CSI-IM and/or SSB (reference signals) and aperiodic reporting on L1 according to all entries in the associatedReportConfigInfoList for that trigger state.

csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference
CSI-IM-ResourceSet for interference measurement. Entry number in csi-IM-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigId above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on). The indicated CSI-IM-ResourceSet should have exactly the same number of resources like the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS.
csi-SSB-ResourceSet, csi-SSB-ResourceSet2
CSI-SSB-ResourceSet for channel measurements. Entry number in csi-SSB-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigId above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on).
nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference
NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet for interference measurement. Entry number in nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigId above (value 1 corresponds to the first entry, value 2 to the second entry, and so on). 
qcl-info, qcl-info2
List of references to TCI-States for providing the QCL source and QCL type for each NZP-CSI-RS-Resource listed in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated by resourceSet within nzp-CSI-RS. Each TCI-StateId refers to the TCI-State which has this value for tci-StateId and is defined in tci-StatesToAddModList or in dl-OrJointTCI-StateList in the PDSCH-Config included in the BWP-Downlink corresponding to the serving cell and to the DL BWP to which the resourcesForChannelMeasurement (in the CSI-ReportConfig indicated by reportConfigId above) belong to. First entry in qcl-info corresponds to first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources of that NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, second entry in qcl-info corresponds to second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.5.1). When this field is absent for aperiodic CSI RS, the UE shall use QCL information included in the  "indicated" DL only/Joint TCI state as specified in TS 38.214
reportConfigId

CSI-ReportConfig field descriptions
carrier
Indicates in which serving cell the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated below are to be found. If the field is absent, the resources are on the same serving cell as this report configuration.
codebookConfig
Codebook configuration for Type-1 or Type-2 including codebook subset restriction. Network can only configure one of codebookConfig, codebookConfig-r16 or codebookConfig-r17 to a UE. The network includes codebookConfig-v1730 only if codebookConfig-r17 is configured.
cqi-BitsPerSubband
This field can only be present if cqi-FormatIndicator is set to subbandCQI. If the field is configured with bits4, the UE uses 4-bit sub-band CQI. If the field is not present and cqi-FormatIndicator is set to subbandCQI, the UE uses 2-bit sub-band differential CQI.
cqi-FormatIndicator
Indicates whether the UE shall report a single (wideband) or multiple (subband) CQI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
cqi-Table
Which CQI table to use for CQI calculation (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.1). For a RedCap UE, CQI table 2 is only supported if the UE indicates support of 256QAM for PDSCH.
csi-IM-ResourcesForInterference
CSI IM resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfigId of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only CSI-IM resources. The bwp-Id in that CSI-ResourceConfig is the same value as the bwp-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement.
csi-ReportingBand
Indicates a contiguous or non-contiguous subset of subbands in the bandwidth part which CSI shall be reported for. Each bit in the bit-string represents one subband. The right-most bit in the bit string represents the lowest subband in the BWP. The choice determines the number of subbands (subbands3 for 3 subbands, subbands4 for 4 subbands, and so on) (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). This field is absent if there are less than 24 PRBs (no sub band) and present otherwise (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
csi-ReportMode
Configures the CSI report modes Mode1 or Mode 2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2)
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
groupBasedBeamReporting
Turning on/off group beam based reporting (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). If groupBasedBeamReporting (without suffix) is set to disabled, groupBasedBeamReporting-v1710 is absent.
non-PMI-PortIndication
Port indication for RI/CQI calculation. For each CSI-RS resource in the linked ResourceConfig for channel measurement, a port indication for each rank R, indicating which R ports to use. Applicable only for non-PMI feedback (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
The first entry in non-PMI-PortIndication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the CSI-ResourceConfig whose CSI-ResourceConfigId is indicated in a CSI-MeasId together with the above CSI-ReportConfigId; the second entry in non-PMI-PortIndication corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the second entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig, and so on until the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the last entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the first entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig. Then the next entry corresponds to the NZP-CSI-RS-Resource indicated by the first entry in nzp-CSI-RS-Resources in the NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet indicated in the second entry of nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceSetList of the same CSI-ResourceConfig and so on.
nrofReportedGroups
Number of reported resource groups per CSI-report. Value n1 means one resource group, n2 means 2 resource groups, and so on. If nrofReportedGroups is configured, the UE ignores groupBasedBeamReporting (without suffix).
nrofReportedRS
The number (N) of measured RS resources to be reported per report setting in a non-group-based report. N <= N_max, where N_max is either 2 or 4 depending on UE capability.
(see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4) When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
numberOfSingleTRP-CSI-Mode1
Configures the number of reported X CSIs when csi-ReportMode is set to 'Mode 1' as described in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2. The field is present only if csi-ReportMode configures Mode 1.
nzp-CSI-RS-ResourcesForInterference
NZP CSI RS resources for interference measurement. csi-ResourceConfigId of a CSI-ResourceConfig included in the configuration of the serving cell indicated with the field "carrier" above. The CSI-ResourceConfig indicated here contains only NZP-CSI-RS resources. The bwp-Id in that CSI-ResourceConfig is the same value as the bwp-Id in the CSI-ResourceConfig indicated by resourcesForChannelMeasurement.
p0alpha
Index of the p0-alpha set determining the power control for this CSI report transmission (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1.2).
pdsch-BundleSizeForCSI
PRB bundling size to assume for CQI calculation when reportQuantity is CRI/RI/i1/CQI. If the field is absent, the UE assumes that no PRB bundling is applied (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4.2).
pmi-FormatIndicator
Indicates whether the UE shall report a single (wideband) or multiple (subband) PMI. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
pucch-CSI-ResourceList
Indicates which PUCCH resource to use for reporting on PUCCH.
reportConfigType
Time domain behavior of reporting configuration.
reportFreqConfiguration
Reporting configuration in the frequency domain. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4).
reportQuantity
The CSI related quantities to report. see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1. If the field reportQuantity-r16 or reportQuantity-r17 is present, UE shall ignore reportQuantity (without suffix). Network does not configure reportQuantity-r17 together with reportQuantity-r16.
reportSlotConfig
Periodicity and slot offset (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.1.4). If the field reportSlotConfig-v1530 is present, the UE shall ignore the value provided in reportSlotConfig (without suffix).

Note: For unpaired spectrum, the UE is not expected to be configured the value of s6, s8, s12, s14 and s16.
pusch-TimeDomainWindowLength
Configures the length of a nominal time domain window in number of consecutive slots for DMRS bundling for PUSCH. The value shall not exceed the maximum duration for DMRS bundling for PUSCH as specified in TS 38.306 [26]. For PUSCH repetition type A/B, if this field is absent, the UE shall apply the default value that is the minimum value in the unit of consecutive slots of the time duration for the transmission of all PUSCH repetitions and the maximum duration for DMRS bundling for PUSCH as specified in TS 38.306 [26]. For TBoMS, if this field is absent, the UE shall apply the default value that is the minimum value in the unit of consecutive slots of the duration of TBoMS transmission (including repetition of TBoMS) and the maximum duration for DMRS bundling for PUSCH as specified in TS 38.306 [26].
pusch-WindowRestart
Indicates whether UE bundles PUSCH DMRS remaining in a nominal time domain window after event(s) triggered by DCI or MAC CE that violate power consistency and phase continuity requirements is enabled (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.7).
NOTE:	Events, which are triggered by DCI or MAC CE, but do not require UE capability to resume maintaining power consistency and/or phase continuity as specified in clause 6.1.7 of TS 38.214 [19], are excluded.

dmrs-Type
Selection of the DMRS type to be used for UL (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3) If the field is absent, the UE uses DMRS type 1.
dmrs-Uplink
This field indicates whether low PAPR DMRS is used, as specified in TS38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1.
dmrs-UplinkTransformPrecoding
This field indicates whether low PAPR DMRS is used for PUSCH with pi/2 BPSK modulation, as specified in TS38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.2. The network configures this field only if tp-pi2BPSK is configured in PUSCH-Config.
maxLength
The maximum number of OFDM symbols for UL front loaded DMRS. len1 corresponds to value 1. len2 corresponds to value 2. If the field is absent, the UE applies value len1. If set to len2, the UE determines the actual number of DM-RS symbols by the associated DCI. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
nPUSCH-Identity
Parameter: N_ID^(PUSCH) for DFT-s-OFDM DMRS. If the value is absent or released, the UE uses the value Physical cell ID (physCellId). See TS 38.211 [16].
phaseTrackingRS
Configures uplink PTRS (see TS 38.211 [16]).
pi2BPSK-ScramblingID0, pi2BPSK-ScramblingID1
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for pi/2 BPSK DMRS for PUSCH (see TS 38.211 [16], Clause 6.4.1.1.2). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId) of the serving cell.
scramblingID0
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
scramblingID1
UL DMRS scrambling initialization for CP-OFDM. (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value Physical cell ID (physCellId).
sequenceGroupHopping
For DMRS transmission with transform precoder the NW may configure group hopping by the cell-specific parameter groupHoppingEnabledTransformPrecoding in PUSCH-ConfigCommon. In this case, the NW may include this UE specific field to disable group hopping for PUSCH transmission except for Msg3, i.e., to override the configuration in PUSCH-ConfigCommon (see TS 38.211 [16]). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for Msg3.
sequenceHopping
Determines if sequence hopping is enabled for DMRS transmission with transform precoder for PUSCH transmission other than Msg3 (sequence hopping is always disabled for Msg3). If the field is absent, the UE uses the same hopping mode as for msg3. The network does not configure simultaneous group hopping and sequence hopping. See TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.1.2.

initialDownlinkBWP
The initial downlink BWP configuration for a PCell. The network configures the locationAndBandwidth so that the initial downlink BWP contains the entire CORESET#0 of this serving cell in the frequency domain. The UE applies the locationAndBandwidth upon reception of this field (e.g. to determine the frequency position of signals described in relation to this locationAndBandwidth) but it keeps CORESET#0 until after reception of RRCSetup/RRCResume/RRCReestablishment.

If present, RedCap UEs use this DL BWP instead of initialDownlinkBWP. If the locationAndBandwidth of this BWP contains the entire CORESET#0, the UE applies the locationAndBandwidth upon reception of this field (e.g. to determine the frequency position of signals described in relation to this locationAndBandwidth) but it keeps CORESET#0 until after reception of RRCSetup/RRCResume/RRCReestablishment. Otherwise, i.e., if the locationAndBandwidth of this BWP does not contain the entire CORESET#0, the UE uses this BWP for receiving DL messages during initial access (Msg2, MsgB, Msg4) and after initial access.
If absent, RedCap UEs use initialDownlinkBWP provided that it does not exceed the RedCap UE maximum bandwidth (see also clause 5.2.2.4.2).

PEI-Config field descriptions
payloadSizeDCI-2-7
Payload size of PEI DCI, i.e., DCI format 2_7. The size is no larger than the payload size of paging DCI which has maximum of 41 bits and 43 bits for licensed and unlicensed spectrums, respectively.
pei-FrameOffset
Offset, in number of frames from the start of a reference frame for PEI-O to the start of a first paging frame of the paging frames associated with the PEI-O, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4A.
po-NumPerPEI
The number of PO(s) associated with one PEI monitoring occasion. It is a factor of the total PO number in a paging cycle, i.e N x Ns, as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. The maximum number of PF associated with one PEI monitoring occasion is 2. The number of PO mapping to one PEI should be multiple of Ns when po-NumPerPEI is larger than Ns.

SubgroupConfig field descriptions
subgroupsNumPerPO
Total number of subgroups per Paging Occasion (PO) for UE to read subgroups indication from physical-layer signaling. The field represents the sum of CN-assigned and UEID-based subgroups supported by the network. When PEI-Config is configured, there is always at least one subgroup (UEID-based subgroup or CN-assigned subgroup) configured.
subgroupsNumForUEID
Number of subgroups per Paging Occasion (PO) for UE to read subgroups indication from physical-layer signaling, for UEID-based subgrouping method. When present, the field is set to an integer smaller than or equal to subgroupsNumPerPO. subgroupsNumPerPO equals to subgroupsNumForUEID when the network does not support CN-assigned subgrouping. The field is absent when the network only supports CN-assigned subgrouping. Both this field and subgroupsNumPerPO are equal to 1 when the network does not support subgrouping.

FeatureCombinationPreambles field descriptions
deltaPreamble
Power offset between msg3 or msgA-PUSCH and RACH preamble transmission. If configured, this parameter overrides msg3-DeltaPreamble or msgA-DeltaPreamble, Actual value = field value * 2 [dB] (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1). If msgA-DeltaPreamble is configured in separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config-r17, this field is absent.
featureCombination
Indicates which combination of features that the preambles indicated by this IE are associated with. The UE ignores a RACH resource defined by this FeatureCombinationPreambles if any feature within the featureCombination is not supported by the UE or if any of the spare fields within the featureCombination is set to true.
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).
msgA-RSRP-Threshold
The UE selects 2-step random access type to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). This field is only present if both 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured for the concerned feature combination in the BWP. If configured, this parameter overrides msgA-RSRP-Threshold-r16. If absent, the UE applies msgA-RSRP-Threshold-r16, if configured
numberOfPreamblesPerSSB-ForThisPartition
It determines how many consecutive preambles are associated to the Feature Combination starting from the starting preamble(s) per SSB.
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
It determines how many consecutive preambles per SSB are associated to Group A starting from the starting preamble(s). The remaining preambles associated to the Feature Combination are associated to Group B
ra-SizeGroupA
Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2). If this feature combination preambles are associated to a RACH-ConfigCommon-twostepRA, this field correspond to ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA, otherwise it corresponds to ra-Msg3SizeGroupA.
rsrp-ThresholdSSB
L1-RSRP threshold used for determining whether a candidate beam may be used by the UE. If this parameter is included in FeatureCombinationPreambles which is included in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA, it corresponds to msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB, as defined in TS 38.321 [3]. If this parameter is included in FeatureCombinationPreambles which is included in RACH-ConfigCommon, it it corresponds to rsrp-ThresholdSSB, as defined in TS 38.321 [3].
separateMsgA-PUSCH-Config
If present it specifies how the 2-step RACH preambles identified by this FeatureCombinationPreambles are mapped to a PUSCH slot separate from the one defined in MsgA-ConfigCommon-r16. If the field is absent, the UE should apply the corresponding parameter in the RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA of the BWP which includes the FeatureCombinationPreambles IE.
ssb-SharedRO-MaskIndex
Mask index (see TS 38.321 [3]).
Indicates a subset of ROs where preambles are allocated for this feature combination.
If this field is configured within FeatureCombinationPreambles which is included in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA:
-	in case of separate ROs are configured for 4-step and 2-step random access, this field indicates a subset of ROs configured within this RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA;
-	in case shared ROs are used for 4-step and 2-step random access, it indicates the subset of ROs configured within RACH-ConfigCommon, which are the subset of ROs configured for 2-step random access.
This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, all ROs configured in RACH-ConfigCommon or RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA containing this FeatureCombinationPreambles are shared.
startPreambleForThisPartition
It defines the first preamble associated with the Feature Combination. If the UE is provided with a number N of SSB block indexes associated with one PRACH occasion, and N<1, the first preamble in each PRACH occasion is the one having the same index as indicated by this field. If N>=1, N blocks of preambles associated with the Feature Combination are defined, each having start index + startPreambleForThisPartition, where n refers to SSB block index (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1).

LocationMeasurementInfo field descriptions
carrierFreq
The EARFCN value of the carrier received from upper layers for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements.
measPRS-Offset
Indicates the requested gap offset for performing RSTD measurements towards E-UTRA. It is the smallest subframe offset from the beginning of subframe 0 of SFN=0 of the serving cell of the requested gap for measuring PRS positioning occasions in the carrier frequency carrierFreq for which the UE needs to perform the inter-RAT RSTD measurements. The PRS positioning occasion information is received from upper layers. The value of measPRS-Offset is obtained by mapping the starting subframe of the PRS positioning occasion in the measured cell onto the corresponding subframe in the serving cell and is calculated as the serving cell's number of subframes from SFN=0 mod 40.
The UE shall take into account any additional time required by the UE to start PRS measurements on the other carrier when it does this mapping for determining the measPRS-Offset.
NOTE:	Figure 6.2.2-1 in TS 36.331[10] illustrates the measPRS-Offset field.

MeasGapConfig field descriptions
gapAssociationPRS
Indicates that PRS measurement is associated with this measurement gap. The network only includes this field for one per UE gap. If concurrent gap (i.e. one of the gap combination as defined in Table 9.1.8-1 in TS 38.133 [14]) is configured and no gap is configured with this field, the PRS measurement is associated with the gap configured via gapUE, if available.
gapFR1
Indicates measurement gap configuration that applies to FR1 only. In (NG)EN-DC, gapFR1 cannot be set up by NR RRC (i.e. only LTE RRC can configure FR1 measurement gap). In NE-DC, gapFR1 can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure FR1 gap). In NR-DC, gapFR1 can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. gapFR1 can not be configured together with gapUE. The applicability of the FR1 measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
gapFR2
Indicates measurement gap configuration applies to FR2 only. In (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC, gapFR2 can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure FR2 gap). In NR-DC, gapFR2 can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. gapFR2 cannot be configured together with gapUE. The applicability of the FR2 measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
gapOffset
Value gapOffset is the gap offset of the gap pattern with MGRP indicated in the field mgrp. The value range is from 0 to mgrp-1. If ncsgInd-r17 is present, this offset value refers to the starting point of VIL1 (the visible interruption length before the ML).
gapPriority
Indicates the priority of this measurement gap (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.1.8.3). Value 1 indicates highest priority, value 2 indicates second level priority, and so on.
gapSharing
Indicates the measurement gap sharing scheme that applies to this GapConfig. For applicability of the different gap sharing schemes, see TS 38.133 [14]. Value scheme00 corresponds to scheme "00", value scheme01 corresponds to scheme "01", and so on.
gapToAddModList
A list of of measurement gap configuration to be added or modified. If more than one measurement gap is configured (i.e. concurrent measurement gap as specified in TS 38.133[14], clause 9.1.8), the maximum number of configured measurement gap is limited by the gap combinations defined in Table 9.1.8-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. The network configures at most one NCSG or pre-configured measurement gap for a given gap type. In this version of the specification, the network configures this field only in NR standalone. This field is used only for a UE that supports pre-configured measurement gap, concurrent measurement gap, or NCSG. In this version of the specification, the network does not configure concurrent measurement gap together with MUSIM gap or preconfigured measurement gap for positioning.
gapToReleaseList
A list of measurement gap configuration to be released.
gapType
Indicates the type of this measurement gap. Value perUE indicates that it is a per UE measurement gap, value perFR1 indicates that it is an FR1 measurement gap, and value perFR2 indicates that it is an FR2 measurement gap.
gapUE
Indicates measurement gap configuration that applies to all frequencies (FR1 and FR2). In (NG)EN-DC, gapUE cannot be set up by NR RRC (i.e. only LTE RRC can configure per UE measurement gap). In NE-DC, gapUE can only be set up by NR RRC (i.e. LTE RRC cannot configure per UE gap). In NR-DC, gapUE can only be set up in the measConfig associated with MCG. If gapUE is configured, then neither gapFR1 nor gapFR2 can be configured. The applicability of the per UE measurement gap is according to Table 9.1.2-2 and Table 9.1.2-3 in TS 38.133 [14].
measGapId
The ID of this measurement gap configuration.
mgl
Value mgl is the measurement gap length in ms of the measurement gap. If ncsgInd-r17 is not present, the measurement gap length is according to in Table 9.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. If ncsgInd-r17 is present, this field indicates the measurement length (ML) in NCSG pattern and is configured according to Table 9.1.9.3-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. Value ms1dot5 corresponds to 1.5 ms, ms3 corresponds to 3 ms and so on. If mgl-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the mgl (without suffix). Value ms1, ms2, and ms5 can only be configured if ncsgInd is present.
mgrp
If ncsgInd-r17 is not present, the mgrp field indicates the measurement gap repetition period in (ms) of the measurement gap according to Table 9.1.2-1 in TS 38.133 [14]. If ncsgInd-r17 is present, the mgrp field indicates the Visible Interruption Repetition Period (VIRP) of NCSG pattern and is configured according to Table 9.1.9.3-1 in TS 38.133 [14].
mgta
Value mgta is the measurement gap timing advance in ms. The applicability of the measurement gap timing advance is according to clause 9.1.2 of TS 38.133 [14], or according to clause 9.1.9 of TS 38.133 [14] if ncsgInd is present. Value ms0 corresponds to 0 ms, ms0dot25 corresponds to 0.25 ms, ms0dot5 corresponds to 0.5 ms and ms0dot75 corresponds to 0.75 ms. For FR2, the network only configures 0 ms and 0.25 ms if ncsgInd is not present. If ncsgInd is present, the network only configures 0ms for per-UE NCSG and FR1 NCSG and only configures 0ms or 0.75ms for FR2 NCSG. Value ms0dot75 can only be configured if ncsgInd is present.
ncsgInd
Indicates that the measurement gap is a NCSG as specified in 38.133 [14].
posMeasGapPreConfigToAddModList
List of preconfigured measurement gap for positioning to add and/or modify. All the gaps configured are associated with the measurement of PRS for RSTD, UE-RxTx Time Difference, PRS-RSRP and PRS-RSRPP as defined in TS 38.215 [9]. In this version of the specification, the network does not configure preconfigured measurement gap for positioning together with concurrent measurement gap or MUSIM gap.
posMeasGapPreConfigToReleaseList
List of preconfigured measurement gap for positioning to release.
preConfigInd
Indicates whether the measurement gap is a pre-configured measurement gap.
refFR2ServCellAsyncCA
Indicates the FR2 serving cell identifier whose SFN and subframe is used for FR2 gap calculation for this gap pattern with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s).
refServCellIndicator
Indicates the serving cell whose SFN and subframe are used for gap calculation for this gap pattern. Value pCell corresponds to the PCell, pSCell corresponds to the PSCell, and mcg-FR2 corresponds to a serving cell on FR2 frequency in MCG.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
AsyncCA
This field is mandatory present when configuring FR2 gap pattern to UE in:
- (NG)EN-DC or NR SA with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s);
- NE-DC or NR-DC with asynchronous CA involving FR2 carrier(s), if the field refServCellIndicator is set to mcg-FR2.
In case the gap pattern to UE in NE-DC and NR-DC is already configured and the serving cell used for the gap calculation corresponds to a serving cell on FR2 frequency in MCG, then the field is optionally present, need M. Otherwise, it is absent, Need R.
NEDCorNRDC
This field is mandatory present when configuring gap pattern to UE in NE-DC or NR-DC. In case the gap pattern to UE in NE-DC and NR-DC is already configured, then the field is absent, need M. Otherwise, it is absent.
PRS
This field is optionally present, Need R, when configuring gap pattern to UE for measurements of DL-PRS configured via LPP (TS 37.355 [49]). Otherwise, it is absent.

RSSI-ResourceConfigCLI field descriptions
nrofPRBs
Allowed size of the measurement BW. Only multiples of 4 are allowed. The smallest configurable number is the minimum of 4 and the width of the active DL BWP. If the configured value is larger than the width of the active DL BWP, the UE shall assume that the actual CLI-RSSI resource bandwidth is within the active DL BWP.
nrofSymbols
Within a slot that is configured for CLI-RSSI measurement (see slotConfiguration), the UE measures the RSSI from startPosition to startPosition + nrofSymbols - 1. The configured CLI-RSSI resource does not exceed the slot boundary of the reference SCS. If the SCS of configured DL BWP(s) is larger than the reference SCS, network configures startPosition and nrofSymbols such that the configured CLI-RSSI resource not to exceed the slot boundary corresponding to the configured BWP SCS. If the reference SCS is larger than SCS of configured DL BWP(s), network ensures startPosition and nrofSymbols are integer multiple of reference SCS divided by configured BWP SCS.
refServCellIndex

Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:    15, 30, or 60 kHz
FR2-1:  60 or 120 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
UE performs CLI-RSSI measurement with the SCS of the active bandwidth part within the configured CLI-RSSI resource in the active BWP regardless of the reference SCS of the measurement resource.
startPosition
OFDM symbol location of the CLI-RSSI resource within a slot.
startPRB
Starting PRB index of the measurement bandwidth. For the case where the reference subcarrier spacing is smaller than subcarrier spacing of active DL BWP(s), network configures startPRB and nrofPRBs are as a multiple of active BW SCS divided by reference SCS.

ref-ServCellId
Indicates the FR2-2 reference serving cell index for the TCI state. Network includes this field if tci-StateInfo is present. This field is only applicable for operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR2-2 and network does not configure this if the UE does not have any serving cells in FR2-2.
rmtc-Bandwidth
Indicates the bandwidth for the RSSI measurement (see TS 38. 215 [9], clause 5.1.21).
rmtc-Frequency
Indicates the center frequency of the measured bandwidth for a frequency which operates with shared spectrum channel access (see TS 38. 215 [9], clause 5.1.21).

Hence, if the UE is configured with a serving cell for which (absoluteFrequencySSB, subcarrierSpacing) in ServingCellConfigCommon is equal to (ssbFrequency, ssbSubcarrierSpacing) in this MeasObjectNR, this field indicates whether the UE can utilize the timing of this serving cell to derive the index of SS block transmitted by neighbour cell. Otherwise, this field indicates whether the UE may use the timing of any detected cell on that target frequency to derive the SSB index of all neighbour cells on that frequency.
deriveSSB-IndexFromCellInter
If this field is present, UE assumes SFN and frame boundary alignment between the reference serving cell indicated by ServCellIndex and all neighbour cells in this MeasObjectNR as specified in TS 38.133 [14]. This field also indicates that the UE can utilize the timing of the reference serving cell indicated by ServCellIndex to derive the index of SS block transmitted by all inter-frequency neighbour cells on the frequency indicated by the MeasObjectNR. When this field is included, the network should set deriveSSB-IndexFromCell to true.
ssb-ToMeasure
The set of SS blocks to be measured within the SMTC measurement duration. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not to be measured while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is to be measured (see TS 38.215 [9]). When the field is not configured the UE measures on all SS blocks. Regardless of the value of this field, SS/PBCH blocks outside of the applicable smtc are not to be measured. See TS 38.215 [9] clause 5.1.1.

NTN-Config field descriptions
EphemerisInfo
This field provides satellite ephemeris either in format of position and velocity state vector or in format of orbital parameters. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes to ephemerisInfo should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
epochTime
Indicate the epoch time for the NTN assistance information. When explicitly provided through SIB, or through dedicated signaling, the EpochTime is the starting time of a DL sub-frame, indicated by a SFN and a sub-frame number signaled together with the assistance information. For serving cell, the field sfn indicates the current SFN or the next upcoming SFN after the frame where the message indicating the epochTime is received. For neighbour cell, the sfn indicates the SFN nearest to the frame where the message indicating the epochTime is received. The reference point for epoch time of the serving or neighbour NTN payload ephemeris and Common TA parameters is the uplink time synchronization reference point. If this field is absent, the epoch time is the end of SI window where this SIB19 is scheduled. This field is mandatory present when ntn-Config is provided in dedicated configuration. If this field is absent in ntn-Config provided via NTN-NeighCellConfig the UE uses epoch time of the serving cell, otherwise the field is based on the timing of the serving cell, i.e. the SFN and sub-frame number indicated in this field refers to the SFN and sub-frame of the serving cell. In case of handover or conditional handover, this field is based on the timing of the target cell, i.e. the SFN and sub-frame number indicated in this field refers to the SFN and sub-frame of the target cell. For the target cell the UE considers epoch time, indicated by the SFN and sub-frame number in this field, to be the frame nearest to the frame in which the message indicating the epoch time is received. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes to epochTime should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
cellSpecificKoffset
Scheduling offset used for the timing relationships that are modified for NTN (see TS 38.213 [13]). The unit of the field K_offset is number of slots for a given subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz. If the field is absent UE assumes value 0.
kmac
Scheduling offset provided by network if downlink and uplink frame timing are not aligned at gNB. It is needed for UE action and assumption on downlink configuration indicated by a MAC CE command in PDSCH (see TS 38.213 [13]). If the field is absent UE assumes value 0.
For the reference subcarrier spacing value for the unit of K_mac in FR1, a value of 15 kHz is used. The unit of K_mac is number of slots for a given subcarrier spacing.
ntn-PolarizationDL
If present, this parameter indicates polarization information for downlink transmission on service link: including Right hand, Left hand circular polarizations (RHCP, LHCP) and Linear polarization.
ntn-PolarizationUL
If present, this parameter indicates Polarization information for uplink service link.
If not present and ntn-PolarizationDL is present, UE assumes the same polarization for UL and DL.
ntn-UlSyncValidityDuration
A validity duration configured by the network for assistance information (i.e. Serving and/or neighbour satellite ephemeris and Common TA parameters) which indicates the maximum time duration (from epochTime) during which the UE can apply assistance information without having acquired new assistance information.
The unit of ntn-UlSyncValidityDuration is second. Value s5 corresponds to 5 s, value s10 indicate 10 s and so on. This parameter applies to both connected and idle mode UEs. If this field is absent in ntn-Config provided via NTN-NeighCellConfig, the UE uses validity duration from the serving cell assistance information. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of ntn-UlSyncValidityDuration should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1. ntn-UlSyncValidityDuration is only updated when at least one of epochTime, ta-Info, ephemerisInfo is updated.
ta-Common
Network-controlled common timing advanced value and it may include any timing offset considered necessary by the network. ta-Common with value of 0 is supported. The granularity of ta-Common is 4.072 × 10^(-3) μs. Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of ta-Common should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
ta-CommonDrift
Indicate drift rate of the common TA. The granularity of ta-CommonDrift is 0.2 × 10^(-3) μs⁄s. Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of ta-CommonDrift should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
ta-CommonDriftVariant
Indicate drift rate variation of the common TA. The granularity of ta-CommonDriftVariant is 0.2×10^(-4) μs⁄s^2. Values are given in unit of corresponding granularity. This field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of ta-CommonDriftVariant should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
ta-Report
When this field is included in SIB19, it indicates reporting of timing advanced is enabled during Random Access due to RRC connection establishment or RRC connection resume, and during RRC connection reestablishment. When this field is included in ServingCellConfigCommon within dedicated signalling, it indicates TA reporting is enabled during Random Access due to reconfiguration with sync (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.4.8).

NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet field descriptions
aperiodicTriggeringOffset, aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16, aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r17
Offset X between the slot containing the DCI that triggers a set of aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resources and the slot in which the CSI-RS resource set is transmitted. For aperiodicTriggeringOffset, the value 0 corresponds to 0 slots, value 1 corresponds to 1 slot, value 2 corresponds to 2 slots, value 3 corresponds to 3 slots, value 4 corresponds to 4 slots, value 5 corresponds to 16 slots, value 6 corresponds to 24 slots. For aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r16 and aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r17, the value indicates the number of slots. aperiodicTriggeringOffset-r17 is applicable to SCS 480 kHz and 960 kHz, and only the values of integer multiples of 4 are valid, i.e. 0, 4, 8, and so on. The network configures only one of the fields. When neither field is included, the UE applies the value 0.
aperiodicTriggeringOffsetL2
Indicates triggering offset of aperiodic NZP CSI-RS resources used for fast activation of the SCell (see clause 5.2.1.5.3 of TS 38.214 [19]), when the NZP CSI-RS resources are activated by the MAC CE (see clause 5.9 of TS 38.321 [3]). The value indicates the number of slots.
cmrGroupingAndPairing
Configures CMR groups and pairs. The first nrofResourcesGroup1 resources in the NZP-CSI-RS resource set belong to Group 1 and the remaining resources in the NZP-CSI-RS resource set belong to Group 2. nrofResourcesGroup1 is  and the number of remaining resources in the NZP-CSI-RS resource set belonging to Group 2 is  as specified in TS 38.214 clause 5.2.1.4.1. Maximum total number in Group 1 and Group 2 is 8 (see TS 38.214 [19], clauses 5.2.1.4.1 and 5.2.1.4.2).

The nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceId1-r17 represents the index of the NZP CSI-RS resource in Resource Group 1, and nzp-CSI-RS-ResourceId2-r17 represents the index of the NZP CSI-RS resource in Resource Group 2.
pdc-Info
Indicates that this NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, if configured also with trs-Info, is used for propagation delay compensation. The field can be present only if trs-info is present. The field can be present in only one NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet. If network configures this field for an NZP-CSI-RS-ResourceSet, the UE measures the UE Rx-Tx time difference based on resources configured in this resource set.
repetition
Indicates whether repetition is on/off. If the field is set to off or if the field is absent, the UE may not assume that the NZP-CSI-RS resources within the resource set are transmitted with the same downlink spatial domain transmission filter (see TS 38.214 [19], clauses 5.2.2.3.1 and 5.1.6.1.2). It can only be configured for CSI-RS resource sets which are associated with CSI-ReportConfig with report of L1 RSRP, L1 SINR or "no report".
trs-Info
Indicates that the antenna port for all NZP-CSI-RS resources in the CSI-RS resource set is same. If the field is absent or released the UE applies the value false (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.2.2.3.1).

PDCCH-Config field descriptions
controlResourceSetToAddModList, controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt
List of UE specifically configured Control Resource Sets (CORESETs) to be used by the UE. The network restrictions on configuration of CORESETs per DL BWP are specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1 and TS 38.306 [26]. The UE shall consider entries in controlResourceSetToAddModList and in controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt as a single list, i.e. an entry created using controlResourceSetToAddModList can be modified using controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. In case network reconfigures control resource set with the same ControlResourceSetId as used for commonControlResourceSet or commonControlResourceSetExt configured via PDCCH-ConfigCommon or via SIB20, the configuration from PDCCH-Config always takes precedence and should not be updated by the UE based on servingCellConfigCommon or based on SIB20.
controlResourceSetToReleaseList, controlResourceSetToReleaseListSizeExt
List of UE specifically configured Control Resource Sets (CORESETs) to be released by the UE. This field only applies to CORESETs configured by controlResourceSetToAddModList or controlResourceSetToAddModListSizeExt and does not release the field commonControlResourceSet configured by PDCCH-ConfigCommon and commonControlResourceSetExt configured by SIB20.
downlinkPreemption
Configuration of downlink preemption indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2).
monitoringCapabilityConfig
Configures either Rel-15 PDCCH monitoring capability, Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability or Rel-17 PDCCH monitoring capability for PDCCH monitoring on a serving cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). Value r15monitoringcapability enables the Rel-15 monitoring capability, and value r16monitoringcapability enables the Rel-16 PDCCH monitoring capability. r17monitoringcapability enables the Rel-17 PDCCH multi-slot monitoring capability. For 480 and 960 kHz SCS, only value r17monitoringcapability is applicable.
pdcch-SkippingDurationList
Provides one or more values to derive the skipping duration in unit of slots, as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4. The DCI which schedules data indicates which of the values is to be applied (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4). For the 15kHz SCS, for each entry, only the first 26 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100}. For the 30kHz SCS, for each entry, only the first 46 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 160, 200}. For the 60kHz SCS, for each entry, only the first 86 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 320, 400}. For the 120kHz SCS, for each entry, the 166 values correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 160, 240, 320, 400, 480, 640, 800}. For the 480kHz SCS, for each entry, the 166 values correspond to {4, 8, 12, …, 640, 960, 1280, 1600, 1920, 2560, 3200}. For the 960kHz SCS, for each entry, the 166 values correspond to {8, 16, 24, …, 1280, 1920, 2560, 3200, 3840, 5120, 6400}.
searchSpacesToAddModList, searchSpacesToAddModListExt
List of UE specifically configured Search Spaces or MBS multicast Search Spaces. The network configures at most 10 Search Spaces per BWP per cell (including UE-specific and common Search Spaces). If the network includes searchSpaceToAddModListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in searchSpacesToAddModList in each of them.

Configuration to control the UE behavior to switch from search space group X back to search space group 0, as specified in clause 10 of TS 38.213 [13]. The network only configures either searchSpaceSwitchConfig-r16 or searchSpaceSwitchConfig-r17 for a UE.
tpc-PUCCH
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUCCH.
tpc-PUSCH
Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for PUSCH.

Enable and configure reception of group TPC commands for SRS.
uplinkCancellation
Configuration of uplink cancellation indications to be monitored in this cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.2A).

SearchSpaceSwitchConfig field descriptions
cellGroupsForSwitchList
The list of serving cells which are bundled for the search space group switching purpose (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4). A serving cell can belong to only one CellGroupForSwitch. The network configures the same list for all BWPs of serving cells in the same CellGroupForSwitch.
searchSpaceSwitchDelay
Indicates the value to be applied by a UE for Search Space Set Group switching; corresponds to the P value in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4. The network configures the same value for all BWPs of serving cells in the same CellGroupForSwitch. For 120/480/960 kHz SCS, only values 40,41, ... 52 are valid and the actual value = field value  * SCS/120 kHz i.e. field value 40 corresponds to 40 with 120 kHz SCS, 160 with 480 kHz SCS and 320 with 960 kHz SCS, and so on.
searchSpaceSwitchTimer
Timer (in unit of slots) to control the UE behavior to switch from search space group X back to search space group 0, as specified in clause 10 of TS 38.213 [13]. For the 15kHz SCS, only the first 26 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 80, 100}. For the 30kHz SCS, only the first 46 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, 160, 200}. For the 60kHz SCS, only the first 86 values are valid and correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 80, 120, 160, 200, 240, 320, 400}. For the 120kHz SCS, the 166 values correspond to {1, 2, 3, …, 160, 240, 320, 400, 480, 640, 800}. For the 480kHz SCS, the 166 values correspond to {4, 8, 12, …, 640, 960, 1280, 1600, 1920, 2560, 3200}. For the 960kHz SCS, the 166 values correspond to {8, 16, 24, …, 1280, 1920, 2560, 3200, 3840, 5120, 6400}.

PDCCH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
commonControlResourceSet
An additional common control resource set which may be configured and used for any common or UE-specific search space. If the network configures this field, it uses a ControlResourceSetId other than 0 for this ControlResourceSet. The network configures the commonControlResourceSet in SIB1 so that it is contained in the bandwidth of CORESET#0. If the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP does not contain the entire CORESET#0, the network configures the commonControlResourceSet in the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP in SIB1 for RedCap such that it does not have to be contained in the bandwidth of CORESET#0.
commonSearchSpaceList, commonSearchSpaceListExt, commonSearchSpaceListExt2
A list of additional common search spaces. If the network configures this field, it uses the SearchSpaceIds other than 0. If the field is included, it replaces any previous list, i.e. all the entries of the list are replaced and each of the SearchSpace entries is considered to be newly created and the conditions and Need codes for setup of the entry apply. If the network includes commonSearchSpaceListExt/commonSearchSpaceListExt2, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in commonSearchSpaceList.
controlResourceSetZero
Parameters of the common CORESET#0 which can be used in any common or UE-specific search spaces. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in MIB pdcch-ConfigSIB1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP#0) controlResourceSetZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10 are satisfied.
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O
Offset, in number of symbols, from the start of the reference frame for PEI-O to the start of the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of PEI-O on this BWP, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.4A. For the case po-NumPerPEI is smaller than Ns, UE applies the (floor(i_s/po-NumPerPEI)+1)-th value out of (N_s/po-NumPerPEI) configured values in firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O for the symbol-level offset. When po-NumPerPEI is one or multiple of Ns, UE applies the first configured value in firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPEI-O for the symbol-level offset.
firstPDCCH-MonitoringOccasionOfPO
Indicates the first PDCCH monitoring occasion of each PO of the PF on this BWP, see TS 38.304 [20]. The field sCS120KHZquarterT-SCS60KHZoneEighthT-SCS30KHZoneSixteenthT, sCS120KHZoneEighthT-SCS60KHZoneSixteenthT and sCS120KHZoneSixteenthT can be applied for SCS 480kHz, corresponding to sCS480KHZoneT-SCS120KHZquarterT-SCS60KHZoneEighthT-SCS30KHZoneSixteenthT, sCS480KHZhalfT-SCS120KHZoneEighthT-SCS60KHZoneSixteenthT and sCS480KHZquarterT-SCS120KHZoneSixteenthT in IE DownlinkConfigCommonSIB respectively.
followUnifiedTCI-State
When set to enabled, for PDCCH reception in CORESET #0, the UE applies the "indicated" DL only TCI or joint TCI as specified in TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.5.
pagingSearchSpace
ID of the search space for paging (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive paging in this BWP (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). This field is absent for the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP, if it does not include CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0. In that case, a RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing, shall monitor paging in the initial DL BWP that includes CORESET#0.
pei-ConfigBWP
Provides the configuration for PEI reception in this BWP. If the field is absent, the UE does not receive PEI in this BWP.
pei-SearchSpace
ID of dedicated search space for PEI. It can be configured to one of up to 4 common SS sets configured by commonSearchSpaceList with SearchSpaceId > 0. The CCE aggregation levels and maximum number of PDCCH candidates per CCE aggregation level follows Table 10.1-1 of TS38.213 [13]. SearchSpaceId = 0 can be configured for the case of SS/PBCH block and CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 or 3.
ra-SearchSpace
ID of the Search space for random access procedure (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive RAR in this BWP. This field is mandatory present in the DL BWP(s) if the conditions described in TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15 are met.
sdt-SearchSpace
Common search space for CG-SDT and RA-SDT (see TS 38.213 [13]). If an existingSearchSpace is used, the network only signals the search space ID of the ra-SearchSpace.
searchSpaceMCCH
ID of the search space for MCCH. If the field is absent, the UE does not receive MCCH in this BWP (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). This field is absent for the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP, if it does not include CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0.
searchSpaceMTCH
ID of the search space for MTCH of MBS broadcast. If the field is absent, the UE applies searchSpaceMCCH also for MTCH, (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). This field is absent for the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP, if it does not include CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0.
searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation
ID of the Search space for other system information, i.e., SIB2 and beyond (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1). If the field is absent, the UE does not receive other system information in this BWP. This field is absent for the RedCap-specific initial DL BWP, if it does not include CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0. In that case, a RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor PDCCH to receive other system information using searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation in the initial DL BWP that includes CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0.
searchSpaceSIB1
ID of the search space for SIB1 message. In the initial DL BWP of the UE′s PCell, the network sets this field to 0. If the field is absent, the UE does not receive SIB1 in this BWP. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). This field is absent for the RedCap-specific initial DL BWP, if it does not include CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0. In that case, a RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE shall monitor PDCCH to receive SIB1 using searchSpaceSIB1 in the initial DL BWP that includes CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0.
searchSpaceZero
Parameters of the common SearchSpace#0. The values are interpreted like the corresponding bits in MIB pdcch-ConfigSIB1. Even though this field is only configured in the initial BWP (BWP#0), searchSpaceZero can be used in search spaces configured in other DL BWP(s) than the initial DL BWP if the conditions described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 10, are satisfied.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
InitialBWP-Only
If SIB1 is broadcast the field is mandatory present in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon except it is the RedCap-specific initial BWP not including CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0; it is absent in other BWPs and when sent in system information. If SIB1 is not broadcast and there is an SSB associated to the cell, the field is optionally present, Need M, in the PDCCH-ConfigCommon of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in ServingCellConfigCommon (still with the same setting for all UEs). In other cases, the field is absent.
OtherBWP
This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is not the initialDownlinkBWP and pagingSearchSpace is configured in this BWP. Otherwise this field is absent.
InitialBWP-Paging
This field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is the initialDownlinkBWP or initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap including CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0, and pei-Config is configured in DownlinkConfigCommonSIB. Otherwise, this field is absent.

PDCP-Config field descriptions
cipheringDisabled
If included, ciphering is disabled for this DRB regardless of which ciphering algorithm is configured for the SRB/DRBs. The field may only be included if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field is absent. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
discardTimer
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms10 corresponds to 10 ms, value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms and so on. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
discardTimerExt
Value in ms of discardTimer specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms0dot5 corresponds to 0.5 ms, value ms1 corresponds to 1ms and so on. If this field is present, the field discardTimer is ignored and discardTimerExt is used instead.
discardTimerExt2
Value in ms of discardTimerExt specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms2000 corresponds to 2000 ms. If this field is present, the field discardTimer and discardTimerExt are ignored and discardTimerExt2 is used instead.
drb-ContinueROHC
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the ROHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. This field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated. The network does not include the field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer. This field can be configured for both DRB and multicast MRB.
duplicationState
This field indicates the uplink PDCP duplication state for the associated RLC entities at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, the PDCP duplication state is activated for the associated RLC entity. The index for the indication is determined by ascending order of logical channel ID of all RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity indicated by primaryPath in the order of MCG and SCG, as in clause 6.1.3.32 of TS 38.321 [3]. If the number of associated RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity is two, UE ignores the value in the largest index of this field. If the field is absent, the PDCP duplication states are deactivated for all associated RLC entities. 
ethernetHeaderCompression
This fields configures Ethernet Header Compression. This field can only be configured for a bi-directional DRB or a bi-directional multicast MRB. The network reconfigures ethernetHeaderCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment and with neither drb-ContinueEHC-DL nor drb-ContinueEHC-UL configured. Network only configures this field when uplinkDataCompression is not configured.
headerCompression
If rohc is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in both uplink and downlink. If uplinkOnlyROHC is configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in uplink (there is no header compression in downlink). ROHC can be configured for any bearer type. ROHC and EHC can be both configured simultaneously for a DRB or a multicast MRB. The network reconfigures headerCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment or involving PDCP entity reconfiguration to configure DAPS bearer(s), and without any drb-ContinueROHC. Network configures headerCompression to notUsed when outOfOrderDelivery is configured. Network only configures this field when uplinkDataCompression is not configured.
initialRX-DELIV
Indicates the initial value of RX_DELIV during PDCP window initialization for multicast MRB as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
integrityProtection
Indicates whether or not integrity protection is configured for this radio bearer. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot be changed after the DRB is set up.
maxCID

This field configures UL data transmission when more than two RLC entities are associated with the PDCP entity for DRBs.
outOfOrderDelivery
Indicates whether or not outOfOrderDelivery specified in TS 38.323 [5] is configured. This field should be either always present or always absent, after the radio bearer is established.
pdcp-Duplication
Indicates whether or not uplink duplication status at the time of receiving this IE is configured and activated as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The presence of this field indicates that duplication is configured. PDCP duplication is not configured for CA packet duplication of LTE RLC bearer. The value of this field, when the field is present, indicates the state of the duplication at the time of receiving this IE. If set to true, duplication is activated. The value of this field is always true, when configured for a SRB. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities for UL transmission, this field is always present. If the field moreThanTwoRLC-DRB is present, the value of this field is ignored and the state of the duplication is indicated by duplicationState. For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities, only NR RLC bearer is supported.
pdcp-SN-SizeDL
PDCP sequence number size for downlink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
pdcp-SN-SizeUL
PDCP sequence number size for uplink, 12 or 18 bits, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For SRBs only the value len12bits is applicable. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
primaryPath
Indicates the cell group ID and LCID of the primary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5], clause 5.2.1 for UL data transmission when more than one RLC entity is associated with the PDCP entity. In this version of the specification, only cell group ID corresponding to MCG is supported for SRBs, except for the split SRB2 of the IAB-MT, and, when the SCG is deactivated, for DRBs. The NW indicates cellGroup for split bearers using logical channels in different cell groups. The NW always indicates logicalChannel if CA based PDCP duplication is configured in the cell group indicated by cellGroup of this field.
splitSecondaryPath
Indicates the LCID of the split secondary RLC entity as specified in TS 38.323 [5] for fallback to split bearer operation when UL data transmission with more than two RLC entities is associated with the PDCP entity. This RLC entity belongs to a cell group that is different from the cell group indicated by cellGroup in the field primaryPath.
statusReportRequired
For AM DRBs, AM MRBs and DAPS UM DRBs, indicates whether the DRB or the multicast MRB is configured to send a PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. For DAPS AM DRBs, it also indicates whether the DRB is configured to send a second PDCP status report in the uplink, as specified in TS 38.323 [5].
survivalTimeStateSupport
Indicates whether the DRB associated with this PDCP entity has survival time state support. If this field is configured to be true, all associated RLC entities are activated for PDCP duplication upon reception of a retransmission grant addressed to CS-RNTI, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
t-Reordering
Value in ms of t-Reordering specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value ms0 corresponds to 0 ms, value ms20 corresponds to 20 ms, value ms40 corresponds to 40 ms, and so on.  When the field is absent the UE applies the value infinity. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
ul-DataSplitThreshold
Parameter specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value b0 corresponds to 0 bytes, value b100 corresponds to 100 bytes, value b200 corresponds to 200 bytes, and so on. The network sets this field to infinity for UEs not supporting splitDRB-withUL-Both-MCG-SCG and when the SCG is deactivated. If the field is absent when the split bearer is configured for the radio bearer first time, then the default value infinity is applied.
uplinkDataCompression
Indicates the UDC configuration that the UE shall apply. Network does not configure uplinkDataCompression for a DRB, if headerCompression or ethernetHeaderCompression is already configured or outOfOrderDelivery or DAPS is configured for the DRB. The maximum number of DRBs where uplinkDataCompression can be applied is two. The network reconfigures uplinkDataCompression only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP re-establishment. If the field is set to drb-ContinueUDC, the PDCP entity continues the uplink data compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is set to drb-ContinueUDC only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.

EthernetHeaderCompression field descriptions
drb-ContinueEHC-DL
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the downlink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
drb-ContinueEHC-UL
Indicates whether the PDCP entity continues or resets the uplink EHC header compression protocol during PDCP re-establishment, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]. The field is configured only in case of resuming an RRC connection or reconfiguration with sync, where the PDCP termination point is not changed and the fullConfig is not indicated.
ehc-CID-Length
Indicates the length of the CID field for EHC packet. The value bits7 indicates the length is 7 bits, and the value bits15 indicates the length is 15 bits. Once the field ethernetHeaderCompression-r16 is configured for a DRB or a multicast MRB, the value of the field ehc-CID-Length for this DRB or multicast MRB is not reconfigured to a different value.
ehc-Common
Indicates the configurations that apply for both downlink and uplink.
ehc-Downlink
Indicates the configurations that apply for only downlink. If the field is configured, then Ethernet header compression is configured for downlink. Otherwise, it is not configured for downlink.

The IDs of a second group of RateMatchPatterns defined in PDSCH-Config->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (BWP level) or in ServingCellConfig ->rateMatchPatternToAddModList (cell level). These patterns can be activated dynamically by DCI (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). The field rateMatchPatternGroup2 applies to DCI format 1_1, and the field rateMatchPatternGroup2DCI-1-2 applies to DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
rateMatchPatternToAddModList
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the rate match patterns (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). If a RateMatchPattern with the same RateMatchPatternId is configured in both MBS CFR and its associated BWP, the entire RateMatchPattern configuration, including the set of RBs/REs indicated by the patterns for the rate matching around, shall be the same and they are counted as a single rate match pattern in the total configured rate match patterns as defined in TS 38.214 [19].
rbg-Size
Selection between config 1 and config 2 for RBG size for PDSCH. The UE ignores this field if resourceAllocation is set to resourceAllocationType1 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.2.2.1).
referenceOfSLIVDCI-1-2
Enable using the starting symbol of the PDCCH monitoring occasion in which the DL assignment is detected as the reference of the SLIV for DCI format 1_2. When the RRC parameter enables the utilization of the new reference, the new reference is applied for TDRA entries with K0=0. For other entries (if any) in the same TDRA table, the reference is slot boundary as in Rel-15. PDSCH mapping type A is not supported with the new reference. The new reference of SLIV is not configured for a serving cell configured to be scheduled by cross-carrier scheduling on a scheduling cell with different numerology (see TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.214 [19] clause 5.1.2.1).

–	PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList
The IE PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation is used to configure a time domain relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList contains one or more of such PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations. The network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. The UE determines the bit width of the DCI field based on the number of entries in the PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. Value 0 in the DCI field refers to the first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field refers to the second element in this list, and so on.

PHR-Config field descriptions
dummy
This field is not used in this version of the specification and the UE ignores the received value.
mpe-ProhibitTimer
Value in number of subframes for MPE reporting, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, and so on.
mpe-Reporting-FR2
Indicates whether the UE shall report MPE P-MPR in the PHR MAC control element, as specified in TS 38.321 [3].
mpe-Threshold
Value of the P-MPR threshold in dB for reporting MPE P-MPR when FR2 is configured, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
multiplePHR
Indicates if power headroom shall be reported using the Single Entry PHR MAC control element or Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. True means to use Multiple Entry PHR MAC control element and False means to use the Single Entry PHR MAC control element defined in TS 38.321 [3]. The network configures this field to true for MR-DC and UL CA for NR, and to false in all other cases.
numberOfN
Number of reported P-MPR values in a PHR MAC CE.
phr-ModeOtherCG
Indicates the mode (i.e. real or virtual) used for the PHR of the activated cells that are part of the other Cell Group (i.e. MCG or SCG), when DC is configured. If the UE is configured with only one cell group (no DC), it ignores the field.
phr-PeriodicTimer
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
phr-ProhibitTimer
Value in number of subframes for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value sf0 corresponds to 0 subframe, value sf10 corresponds to 10 subframes, value sf20 corresponds to 20 subframes, and so on.
phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange
Value in dB for PHR reporting as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. Value dB1 corresponds to 1 dB, dB3 corresponds to 3 dB and so on. The same value applies for each serving cell (although the associated functionality is performed independently for each cell).
phr-Type2OtherCell
If set to true, the UE shall report a PHR type 2 for the SpCell of the other MAC entity. See TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.4.6. Network sets this field to false if the UE is not configured with an E-UTRA MAC entity.
twoPHRMode
Indicates if the power headroom shall be reported as two PHRs (each PHR associated with a SRS resource set) is enabled or not.

PUCCH-Config field descriptions
dl-DataToUL-ACK, dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2
List of timing for given PDSCH to the DL ACK (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2). The field dl-DataToUL-ACK applies to DCI format 1_1 and the field dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2 applies to DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3). The dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700 is applicable for NTN and dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17 is applicable for up to 71 GHz. If dl-DataToUL-ACK-r16 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17 or dl-DataToUL-ACK-v1700 is signalled, UE shall ignore the dl-DataToUL-ACK (without suffix). The value -1 corresponds to "inapplicable value" for the case where the A/N feedback timing is not explicitly included at the time of scheduling PDSCH. The fields dl-DataToUL-ACK-r17 and dl-DataToUL-ACK-DCI-1-2-r17 are only applicable for SCS of 480 kHz or 960 kHz.
dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDCI-Format4-1
List of timing for given group-common PDSCH to the DL ACK (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.1.2). The field dl-DataToUL-ACK-MulticastDciFormat4-1 applies to DCI format 4_1 for MBS multicast (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3).
dmrs-BundlingPUCCH-Config
Configuration of the parameters for DMRS bundling for PUCCH (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.7). DMRS bundling for PUCCH is not supported for PUCCH format 0/2. In this release, this is not applicable to FR2-2.
dmrs-UplinkTransformPrecodingPUCCH
This field is used for PUCCH formats 3 and 4 according to TS 38.211, Clause 6.4.1.3.3.1.
format0
Parameters that are common for all PUCCH resources of format 0.
format1
Parameters that are common for all PUCCH resources of format 1.
format2
Parameters that are common for all PUCCH resources of format 2.
format3
Parameters that are common for all PUCCH resources of format 3.
format4
Parameters that are common for all PUCCH resources of format 4.
mappingPattern
Indicates whether the UE should follow Cyclical mapping pattern or Sequential mapping pattern for when a PUCCH resource used for repetitions of a PUCCH transmission includes first and second spatial settings for FR2, or first and second sets of power control parameters for FR1 (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.6).
numberOfBitsForPUCCH-ResourceIndicatorDCI-1-2
Configuration of the number of bits for "PUCCH resource indicator" in DCI format 1_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3).
powerControlSetInfoToAddModList
Configures power control sets for repetition of a PUCCH transmission in FR1. This field is not configured if ul-powerControl is configured in the BWP-UplinkDedicated in which the PUCCH-Config is included.
pucch-PowerControl
Configures power control parameters PUCCH transmission. This field is not configured if unifiedTCI-StateType is configured for the serving cell.
resourceGroupToAddModList, resourceGroupToReleaseList
Lists for adding and releasing groups of PUCCH resources that can be updated simultaneously for spatial relations with a MAC CE.
resourceSetToAddModList, resourceSetToReleaseList
Lists for adding and releasing PUCCH resource sets (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2).
resourceToAddModList, resourceToAddModListExt, resourceToReleaseList
Lists for adding and releasing PUCCH resources applicable for the UL BWP and serving cell in which the PUCCH-Config is defined. The resources defined herein are referred to from other parts of the configuration to determine which resource the UE shall use for which report. If the network includes of resourceToAddModListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in resourceToAddModList.
secondTPCFieldDCI-1-1, secondTPCFieldDCI-1-2
A second TPC field can be configured via RRC for DCI-1-1 and DCI-1-2. Each TPC field is for each closed-loop index value respectively (i.e., 1st /2nd TPC fields correspond to "closedLoopIndex" value = 0 and 1.
spatialRelationInfoToAddModList, spatialRelationInfoToAddModListSizeExt , spatialRelationInfoToAddModListExt
Configuration of the spatial relation between a reference RS and PUCCH. Reference RS can be SSB/CSI-RS/SRS. If the list has more than one element, MAC-CE selects a single element (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.18.8 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.2). The UE shall consider entries in spatialRelationInfoToAddModList and in spatialRelationInfoToAddModListSizeExt as a single list, i.e. an entry created using spatialRelationInfoToAddModList can be modified using spatialRelationInfoToAddModListSizeExt (or deleted using spatialRelationInfoToReleaseListSizeExt) and vice-versa. If the network includes spatialRelationInfoToAddModListExt, it includes the same number of entries, and listed in the same order, as in the concatenation of spatialRelationInfoToAddModList and of spatialRelationInfoToAddModListSizeExt. If unifiedTCI-StateType is configured for the serving cell, no element in this list is configured.
spatialRelationInfoToReleaseList, spatialRelationInfoToReleaseListSizeExt, spatialRelationInfoToReleaseListExt
Lists of spatial relation configurations between a reference RS and PUCCH to be released by the UE.
sps-PUCCH-AN-List
Indicates a list of PUCCH resources for DL SPS HARQ ACK. The field maxPayloadSize is absent for the first and the last SPS-PUCCH-AN in the list. If configured, this overrides n1PUCCH-AN in SPS-config.
sps-PUCCH-AN-ListMulticast
The field is used to configure the list of PUCCH resources per HARQ ACK codebook for MBS multicast.
subslotLengthForPUCCH
Indicates the sub-slot length for sub-slot based PUCCH feedback in number of symbols (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9). Value n2 corresponds to 2 symbols, value n6 corresponds to 6 symbols, value n7 corresponds to 7 symbols. For normal CP, the value is either n2 or n7. For extended CP, the value is either n2 or n6.

Maximum number of UCI information bits that the UE may transmit using this PUCCH resource set (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1). In a PUCCH occurrence, the UE chooses the first of its PUCCH-ResourceSet which supports the number of bits that the UE wants to transmit. The field is absent in the first set (Set0) and in the last configured set since the UE derives the maximum number of UCI information bits as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1. This field can take integer values that are multiples of 4.
resourceList
PUCCH resources of format0 and format1 are only allowed in the first PUCCH resource set, i.e., in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId = 0. This set may contain between 1 and 32 resources. PUCCH resources of format2, format3 and format4 are only allowed in a PUCCH-ResourceSet with pucch-ResourceSetId > 0. If present, these sets contain between 1 and 8 resources each. The UE chooses a PUCCH-Resource from this list as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.3. Note that this list contains only a list of resource IDs. The actual resources are configured in PUCCH-Config.

Conditional Presence

PUCCH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
additionalPRBOffset
When intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is disabled, each common PUCCH resource is mapped to a single PRB on one side of the UL BWP. This parameter determines an additional PRB offset in the PRB mapping for the PUCCH resource. If the field is not configured, the UE shall assume an additional PRB offset of zero.
hoppingId
Cell-specific scrambling ID for group hopping and sequence hopping if enabled, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.2.2.
intra-SlotFH-r17
In case a separate initial UL BWP is configured for RedCap UEs, the presence of this parameter indicates whether intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within the separate initial UL BWP in the common PUCCH resource is enabled for RedCap UEs. If this field is absent, intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is enabled. If this field is present, intra-slot PUCCH frequency hopping within RedCap-specific initial UL BWP is disabled and each PUCCH resource is mapped to a single PRB on one side of the UL BWP and this parameter determines whether the PRB index in the PRB mapping is counted in increasing order from the lower edge or in decreasing order from the upper edge of the UL BWP.
nrofPRBs
Indicates the number of PRBs used per PUCCH resource for PUCCH format 0 and format 1 in FR2-2, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2.1.
p0-nominal
Power control parameter P0 for PUCCH transmissions. Value in dBm. Only even values (step size 2) allowed (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.2).
pucch-GroupHopping
Configuration of group- and sequence hopping for all the PUCCH formats 0, 1, 3 and 4. Value neither implies neither group or sequence hopping is enabled. Value enable enables group hopping and disables sequence hopping. Value disable disables group hopping and enables sequence hopping (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.2.2).
pucch-ResourceCommon
An entry into a 16-row table where each row configures a set of cell-specific PUCCH resources/parameters. The UE uses those PUCCH resources until it is provided with a dedicated PUCCH-Config (e.g. during initial access) on the initial uplink BWP. Once the network provides a dedicated PUCCH-Config for that bandwidth part the UE applies that one instead of the one provided in this field (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 9.2).
pucch-ResourceCommonRedCap
An entry into a 16-row table where each row configures a set of cell-specific PUCCH resources/parameters for RedCap UEs. The UE uses those PUCCH resources until it is provided with a dedicated PUCCH-Config (e.g. during initial access) on the initial uplink BWP.

p0
P0 value for PUSCH with grant (except msg3) in steps of 1dB (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value 0.

P0-PUSCH-Set field descriptions
p0-List
Configuration of {p0-PUSCH, p0-PUSCH} sets for PUSCH. If SRI is present in the DCI, then one p0-PUSCH can be configured in P0-PUSCH-Set. If SRI is not present in the DCI, and both olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-1 and olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-2 are configured to be 1 bit, then one p0-PUSCH can be configured in P0-PUSCH-Set. If SRI is not present in the DCI, and if any of olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-1 and olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-2 is configured to be 2 bits, then two p0-PUSCH values can be configured in P0-PUSCH-Set (see TS 38.213 [13] clause 7 and TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1).
p0-PUSCH-SetId
Configure the index of a p0-PUSCH-Set (see TS 38.213 [13] clause 7 and TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1).

PUSCH-PowerControl field descriptions
deltaMCS
Indicates whether to apply delta MCS. When the field is absent, the UE applies Ks = 0 in delta_TFC formula for PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1).
dummy
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
msg3-Alpha
Dedicated alpha value for msg3 PUSCH (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1). When the field is absent the UE applies the value 1.
olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-1, olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-2
Configures the number of bits for Open-loop power control parameter set indication for DCI format 0_1/0_2 in case SRI is not configured in the DCI. 2 bits is applicable only if SRI is not present in the DCI format 0_1. The field olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-1 applies to DCI format 0_1 and the field olpc-ParameterSetDCI-0-2 applies to DCI format 0_2 (see TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.3.1 and TS 38.213 [13], clause 11).
p0-AlphaSets
Configuration {p0-pusch, alpha} sets for PUSCH (except msg3 and msgA PUSCH), i.e., { {p0,alpha,index1}, {p0,alpha,index2},...} (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1). When no set is configured, the UE uses the P0-nominal for msg3/msgA PUSCH, P0-UE is set to 0 and alpha is set according to either msg3-Alpha or msgA-Alpha (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1).
p0-NominalWithoutGrant
P0 value for UL grant-free/SPS based PUSCH. Value in dBm. Only even values (step size 2) allowed (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.1).

The field pusch-AllocationList-r17 configures one or multiple PUSCH that may be in consecutive or non-consecutive slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1). The puschAllocationList-r16 only has one element in pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-0-1-r16 and in pusch-TimeDomainAllocationListDCI-0-2-r16.
startSymbol
Indicates the index of start symbol for PUSCH for DCI format 0_1/0_2 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1).
startSymbolAndLength
An index giving valid combinations of start symbol and length (jointly encoded) as start and length indicator (SLIV). The network configures the field so that the allocation does not cross the slot boundary. (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.1.2.1).

RACH-ConfigCommon field descriptions
featureCombinationPreamblesList
Specifies a series of preamble partitions each associated to a combination of features and 4-step RA. The network does not configure this list to have more than 16 entries.
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2)
msg1-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2).
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:    15 or 30 kHz
FR2-1:  60 or 120 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
If absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the prach-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGeneric (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1, Table 6.3.3.1-2, Table 6.3.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.3.2-3, TS 38.211 [16]). The value also applies to contention free random access (RACH-ConfigDedicated), to SI-request and to contention-based beam failure recovery (CB-BFR). But it does not apply for contention free beam failure recovery (CF-BFR) (see BeamFailureRecoveryConfig).
msg3-transformPrecoder
Enables the transform precoder for Msg3 transmission according to clause 6.1.3 of TS 38.214 [19]. If the field is absent, the UE disables the transformer precoder (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.3).
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A. This determines implicitly the number of CB preambles per SSB available in group B. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB.
prach-RootSequenceIndex
PRACH root sequence index (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1). The value range depends on whether L=839 or L=139 or L=571 or L=1151. The length of the root sequence corresponding with the index indicated in this IE should be consistent with the one indicated in prach-ConfigurationIndex in the RACH-ConfigDedicated (if configured). If prach-RootSequenceIndex-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the prach-RootSequenceIndex (without suffix).
For FR2-2, only the following values are applicable depending on the used subcarrier spacing:
120 kHz:  L=139, L=571, and L=1151
480 kHz:  L=139, and L=571
960 kHz:  L=139
ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
The initial value for the contention resolution timer (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on.
ra-Msg3SizeGroupA
Transport Blocks size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.2).
ra-Prioritization
Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure on any UL BWP of SpCell for specific Access Identities (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1a).
ra-PrioritizationForAI
Indicates whether the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies for Access Identities. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to Access Identity 1, the next bit corresponds to Access Identity 2. Value 1 indicates that the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies otherwise the field does not apply (see TS 23.501 [32]).
ra-PrioritizationForSlicing
Parameters which apply to configure prioritized CBRA 4-step random access type for slicing.
rach-ConfigGeneric
RACH parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.
restrictedSetConfig
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets, see TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.3.3.1.
rsrp-ThresholdSSB
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
rsrp-ThresholdSSB-SUL
The UE selects SUL carrier to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). The value applies to all the BWPs and all RACH configurations.
ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEighth corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). See TS 38.213 [13].
totalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Total number of preambles used for contention based and contention free 4-step or 2-step random access in the RACH resources defined in RACH-ConfigCommon, excluding preambles used for other purposes (e.g. for SI request). If the field is absent, all 64 preambles are available for RA. The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB, i.e. it should be a multiple of the number of SSBs per RACH occasion.

RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA field descriptions
featureCombinationPreamblesList
Specifies a series of preamble partitions each associated to a combination of features and 2-step RA. The network does not configure this list to have more than 16 entries.
groupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA
Preamble grouping for 2-step random access type. If the field is absent then there is only one preamble group configured and only one msgA PUSCH configuration.
msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO
Number of contention-based preambles used for 2-step RA type from the non-CBRA 4-step type preambles associated with each SSB for RO shared with 4-step type RA. The number of preambles for 2-step RA type shall not exceed the number of preambles per SSB minus the number of contention-based preambles per SSB for 4-step type RA. The possible value range for this parameter needs to be aligned with value range for the configured SSBs per RACH occasion in ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. The field is only applicable for the case of shared ROs with 4-step type random access.
msgA-PRACH-RootSequenceIndex
PRACH root sequence index. If the field is not configured in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA which is configured directly within a BWP (i.e., not within AdditionalRACH-Config), the UE applies the value in field prach-RootSequenceIndex in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. If the field is absent in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA in AdditionalRACH-Config, the UE applies the corresponding value of prach-RootSequenceIndex in RACH-ConfigCommon in the same AdditionalRACH-Config. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access.
For FR2-2, only the following values are applicable depending on the used subcarrier spacing:
120 kHz:  L=139, L=571, and L=1151
480 kHz:  L=139, and L=571
960 kHz:  L=139
msgA-RestrictedSetConfig
Configuration of an unrestricted set or one of two types of restricted sets for 2-step random access type preamble. If the field is not configured in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA which is configured directly within a BWP (i.e. not within AdditionalRACH-Config), the UE applies the value in field restrictedSetConfig in RACH-ConfigCommon in the configured BWP. If the field is absent in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA in AdditionalRACH-Config, the UE applies the value of restrictedSetConfig in RACH-ConfigCommon in the same AdditionalRACH-Config. When both 2-step and 4-step type random access is configured, this field is only configured for the case of separate ROs between 2-step and 4-step type random access.
msgA-RSRP-Threshold
The UE selects 2-step random access type to perform random access based on this threshold (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1). This field is only present if both 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured for the BWP.
msgA-RSRP-ThresholdSSB
UE may select the SS block and corresponding PRACH resource for path-loss estimation and (re)transmission based on SS blocks that satisfy the threshold (see TS 38.213 [13]).
msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB
The meaning of this field is twofold: the CHOICE conveys the information about the number of SSBs per RACH occasion. Value oneEight corresponds to one SSB associated with 8 RACH occasions, value oneFourth corresponds to one SSB associated with 4 RACH occasions, and so on. The ENUMERATED part indicates the number of Contention Based preambles per SSB. Value n4 corresponds to 4 Contention Based preambles per SSB, value n8 corresponds to 8 Contention Based preambles per SSB, and so on. The total number of CB preambles in a RACH occasion is given by CB-preambles-per-SSB * max(1, SSB-per-rach-occasion). If the field is not configured in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA which is configured directly within a BWP (i.e. not within AdditionalRACH-Config) and both 2-step and 4-step are configured for the BWP, the UE applies the value in the field ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon. If the field is not configured in AdditionalRACH-Config and both 2-step and 4-step are configured in AdditionalRACH-Config, the UE applies the value in the field ssb-perRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB in RACH-ConfigCommon in the same AdditionalRACH-Config. The field is not present when RACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step type random access in the BWP.
msgA-SSB-SharedRO-MaskIndex
Indicates the subset of 4-step type ROs shared with 2-step random access type for each SSB. This field is configured when there is more than one RO per SSB. If the field is absent, and 4-step and 2-step has shared ROs, then all ROs are shared.
msgA-SubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of PRACH (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 5.3.2).
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:    15 or 30 kHz
FR2-1:  60 or 120 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz.
If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS as derived from the msgA-PRACH-ConfigurationIndex in RACH-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA (see tables Table 6.3.3.1-1, Table 6.3.3.1-2, Table 6.3.3.2-2 and Table 6.3.3.2-3, TS 38.211 [16]) in case of 2-step only BWP, otherwise the UE applies the same SCS as Msg1 derived from RACH-ConfigCommon. The value also applies to contention free 2-step random access type (RACH-ConfigDedicated).
msgA-TotalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Indicates the total number of preambles used for contention-based and contention-free 2-step random access type when ROs for 2-step are not shared with 4-step. If the field is absent, and 2-step and 4-step does not have shared ROs, all 64 preambles are available for 2-step random access type.
msgA-TransMax
Max number of MsgA preamble transmissions performed before switching to 4-step random access (see TS 38.321 [3], clauses 5.1.1). This field is only applicable when 2-step and 4-step RA type are configured and switching to 4-step type RA is supported. If the field is absent, switching from 2-step RA type to 4-step RA type is not allowed.
ra-ContentionResolutionTimer
The initial value for the contention resolution timer for fallback RAR in case no 4-step random access type is configured (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.5). Value sf8 corresponds to 8 subframes, value sf16 corresponds to 16 subframes, and so on. If both 2-step and 4-step random access type resources are configured on the BWP, then this field is absent. If the field is absent in RACH-ConfigCommonTwoStepRA in AdditionalRACH-Config, the UE shall apply the corresponding value in RACH-ConfigCommon in the same AdditionalRACH-Config.
ra-Prioritization
Parameters which apply for prioritized random access procedure on any UL BWP of SpCell for specific Access Identities (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1a).
ra-PrioritizationForAI
Indicates whether the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies for Access Identities. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to Access Identity 1, the next bit corresponds to Access Identity 2. Value 1 for an Access Identity indicates that the field ra-Prioritization-r16 applies, otherwise the field does not apply.
ra-PrioritizationForSlicingTwoStep
Parameters which apply to configure prioritized CBRA 2-step random access type for slicing.
rach-ConfigGenericTwoStepRA
2-step random access type parameters for both regular random access and beam failure recovery.

GroupB-ConfiguredTwoStepRA field descriptions
messagePowerOffsetGroupB
Threshold for preamble selection. Value is in dB. Value minusinfinity corresponds to –infinity. Value dB0 corresponds to 0 dB, dB5 corresponds to 5 dB and so on. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).
numberOfRA-PreamblesGroupA
The number of CB preambles per SSB in group A for idle/inactive or connected mode. The setting of the number of preambles for each group should be consistent with msgA-SSB-PerRACH-OccasionAndCB-PreamblesPerSSB or msgA-CB-PreamblesPerSSB-PerSharedRO if configured.
ra-MsgA-SizeGroupA
Transport block size threshold in bits below which the UE shall use a contention-based RA preamble of group A. (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.1.1).

CFRA-CSIRS-Resource field descriptions
csi-RS
The ID of a CSI-RS resource defined in the measurement object associated with this serving cell.
ra-OccasionList
RA occasions that the UE shall use when performing CF-RA upon selecting the candidate beam identified by this CSI-RS. The network ensures that the RA occasion indexes provided herein are also configured by prach-ConfigurationIndex and msg1-FDM. Each RACH occasion is sequentially numbered, first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PRACH occasions; second, in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PRACH occasions within a PRACH slot and Third, in increasing order of indexes for PRACH slots.
ra-PreambleIndex
The RA preamble index to use in the RA occasions associated with this CSI-RS.

CFRA field descriptions
occasions
RA occasions for contention free random access. If the field is absent, the UE uses the RA occasions configured in RACH-ConfigCommon in the first active UL BWP.
ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex
Explicitly signalled PRACH Mask Index for RA Resource selection in TS 38.321 [3]. The mask is valid for all SSB resources signalled in ssb-ResourceList.
rach-ConfigGeneric
Configuration of contention free random access occasions for CFRA. The UE shall ignore preambleReceivedTargetPower, preambleTransMax, powerRampingStep, ra-ResponseWindow signaled within this field and use the corresponding values provided in RACH-ConfigCommon.
ssb-perRACH-Occasion
Number of SSBs per RACH occasion.
totalNumberOfRA-Preambles
Total number of preambles used for contention free random access in the RACH resources defined in CFRA, excluding preambles used for other purposes (e.g. for SI request). If the field is absent but the field occasions is present, the UE may assume all the 64 preambles are for RA. The setting should be consistent with the setting of ssb-perRACH-Occasion, if present, i.e. it should be a multiple of the number of SSBs per RACH occasion.

CFRA-SSB-Resource field descriptions
msgA-PUSCH-Resource-Index
Identifies the index of the PUSCH resource used for MSGA CFRA. The PUSCH resource index indicates a valid PUSCH occasion (as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 8.1A) and the associated DMRS resources corresponding to a PRACH slot. The PUSCH resource indexes are sequentially numbered and are mapped to valid PUSCH occasions corresponding to a PRACH slot which are ordered, first, in increasing order of frequency resource indexes for frequency multiplexed PUSCH occasions; second, in increasing order of DMRS resource indexes within a PUSCH occasion, where a DMRS resource index  is determined first in an ascending order of a DMRS port index and then in an ascending order of a DMRS sequence index, third in increasing order of time resource indexes for time multiplexed PUSCH occasions within a PUSCH slot and fourth, in increasing order of indexes for PUSCH slots. For the case of contention free 2-step random access type, if this field is absent, the UE shall use the value 0.

DRB-ToAddMod and MRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
cnAssociation
Indicates if the bearer is associated with the eps-bearerIdentity (when connected to EPC) or sdap-Config (when connected to 5GC).
daps-Config
Indicates that the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
drb-Identity
In case of DC, the DRB identity is unique within the scope of the UE, i.e. an MCG DRB cannot use the same value as a split DRB. For a split DRB the same identity is used for the MCG and SCG parts of the configuration.
eps-BearerIdentity
The EPS bearer ID determines the EPS bearer.
mbs-SessionId
Indicates which multicast MBS session the bearer is associated with.
mrb-Identity
Identification of the multicast MRB.
mrb-IdentityNew
New identity of the multicast MRB when mrb-Identity needs to be changed, e.g. as a result of a handover.
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to termination point change for the bearer, reconfiguration with sync, resuming an RRC connection, or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. It is also applicable for LTE procedures when NR PDCP is configured. Network doesn't include this field for DRB if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
recoverPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should perform recovery according to TS 38.323 [5]. Network doesn't include this field if the bearer is configured as DAPS bearer.
sdap-Config
The SDAP configuration determines how to map QoS flows to DRBs when NR or E-UTRA connects to the 5GC and presence/absence of UL/DL SDAP headers.

RadioBearerConfig field descriptions
securityConfig
Indicates the security algorithm and key to use for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included after AS security has been activated, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse and security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig. The field is not included when configuring SRB1 before AS security is activated.
srb3-ToRelease
Release SRB3. SRB3 release can only be done over SRB1 and only at SCG release and reconfiguration with sync.

SecurityConfig field descriptions
keyToUse
Indicates if the bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig are using the master key or the secondary key for deriving ciphering and/or integrity protection keys. For MR-DC, network should not configure SRB1 and SRB2 with secondary key and SRB3 with the master key. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured keyToUse for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.
securityAlgorithmConfig
Indicates the security algorithm for the signalling and data radio bearers configured with the list in this IE RadioBearerConfig. When the field is not included, the UE shall continue to use the currently configured security algorithm for the radio bearers reconfigured with the lists in this IE RadioBearerConfig.

SRB-ToAddMod field descriptions
discardOnPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should discard stored SDU and PDU according to TS 38.323 [5].
reestablishPDCP
Indicates that PDCP should be re-established. Network sets this to true whenever the security key used for this radio bearer changes. Key change could for example be due to reconfiguration with sync, for SRB2 when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR. For SRB1, when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment in NR, the network does not set this field to true. For LTE SRBs using NR PDCP, it could be for handover, RRC connection reestablishment or resume. Network doesn't include this field if any DAPS bearer is configured.
srb-Identity, srb-Identity-v1700
Value 1 is applicable for SRB1 only. Value 2 is applicable for SRB2 only. Value 3 is applicable for SRB3 only. Value 4 is applicable for SRB4 only. If srb-Identity-v1700 is received for an SRB, the UE shall ignore srb-Identity (i.e. without suffix) for this SRB.

RadioLinkMonitoringConfig field descriptions
additionalPCI
Indicates the physical cell IDs (PCI) of the SSBs in the failureDetectionSet2. If candidateBeamRS-List2 is configured in IE BeamFailureRecoveryRSConfig the field indicates the physical cell IDs (PCI) of the SSBs in the candidateBeamRS-List2.
beamFailureDetectionTimer
Timer for beam failure detection (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17). See also the BeamFailureRecoveryConfig IE. Value in number of "Qout,LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection" Reference Signal (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 6). Value pbfd1 corresponds to 1 Qout,LR reporting period of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal, value pbfd2 corresponds to 2 Qout,LR reporting periods of Beam Failure Detection Reference Signal and so on. 
beamFailureInstanceMaxCount
This field determines after how many beam failure events the UE triggers beam failure recovery (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.17). Value n1 corresponds to 1 beam failure instance, value n2 corresponds to 2 beam failure instances and so on. 
failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList
A list of reference signals for detecting beam failure and/or cell level radio link failure (RLF). The limits of the reference signals that the network can configure are specified in TS 38.213 [13], table 5-1. The network configures at most two detectionResources per BWP for the purpose beamFailure or both. If no RSs are provided for the purpose of beam failure detection, the UE performs beam monitoring based on the activated TCI-State for PDCCH as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 6. If no RSs are provided in this list for the purpose of RLF detection, the UE performs Cell-RLM based on the activated TCI-State of PDCCH as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 5. The network ensures that the UE has a suitable set of reference signals for performing cell-RLM. If failureDetectionSet1-r17 and failureDetectionSet2-r17 are present, the purpose of RadioLinkMonitoringRS in failureDetectionResourcesToAddModList only can be set to rlf.
failureDetectionSet1, failureDetectionSet2
Configures parameters for beamfailure detection towards beam failure detection resources configured in the set. If additional PCIs are configured using additionalPCI-ToAddModList for the serving cell, each RS in one set can be associated only with one PCI. Network always configures the failureDetectionSet1 and failureDetectionSet2 together. failureDetectionSetN is present if and only if candidateBeamRS-List2-r17 is configured. When a failureDetectionSetN is present, after the reconfiguration, the UE shall consider all the reference signals for this failure detection set as activated if at most maxBFD-RS-resourcesPerSetPerBWP-r17 reference signals are configured for each failure detection set, otherwise the UE shall consider all the reference signals in this failure detection set as deactivated. If bfdResourcesToAddModList-r17 in failureDetectionSetN is not present, the UE determines the RS(es) in each failureDetectionSetN as described in TS 38.213 [13], clause 6.

RadioLinkMonitoringRS field descriptions
detectionResource
A reference signal that the UE shall use for radio link monitoring or beam failure detection (depending on the indicated purpose). Only periodic 1-port CSI-RS can be configured on SCell for beam failure detection purpose.
purpose
Determines whether the UE shall monitor the associated reference signal for the purpose of cell- and/or beam failure detection. For SCell, network only configures the value to beamFailure.

RateMatchPattern field descriptions
bitmaps
Indicates rate matching pattern by a pair of bitmaps resourceBlocks and symbolsInResourceBlock to define the rate match pattern within one or two slots, and a third bitmap periodicityAndPattern to define the repetition pattern with which the pattern defined by the above bitmap pair occurs.
controlResourceSet
This ControlResourceSet is used as a PDSCH rate matching pattern, i.e., PDSCH reception rate matches around it. In frequency domain, the resource is determined by the frequency domain resource of the CORESET with the corresponding CORESET ID. Time domain resource is determined by the parameters of the associated search space of the CORESET.
If the field controlResourceSetId-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId (without suffix).
periodicityAndPattern
A time domain repetition pattern at which the pattern defined by symbolsInResourceBlock and resourceBlocks recurs. This slot pattern repeats itself continuously. Absence of this field indicates the value n1 (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
resourceBlocks
A resource block level bitmap in the frequency domain. A bit in the bitmap set to 1 indicates that the UE shall apply rate matching in the corresponding resource block in accordance with the symbolsInResourceBlock bitmap. If used as cell-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "common resource blocks (CRB)". If used for MBS broadcast CFR, the bitmap identifies "physical resource blocks" inside the MBS broadcast CFR. If used as BWP-level rate matching pattern, the bitmap identifies "physical resource blocks" inside the BWP or MBS multicast CFR. The first/ leftmost bit corresponds to resource block 0, and so on (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). 
subcarrierSpacing
The SubcarrierSpacing for this resource pattern. If the field is absent, the UE applies the SCS of the associated BWP. The value kHz15 corresponds to µ=0, the value kHz30 corresponds to µ=1, and so on.
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1):
FR1:    15, 30 or 60 kHz
FR2-1:  60 or 120 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
symbolsInResourceBlock
A symbol level bitmap in time domain. It indicates with a bit set to true that the UE shall rate match around the corresponding symbol. This pattern recurs (in time domain) with the configured periodicityAndPattern (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1).
For oneSlot, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the slot and the last two bits within the bitstring are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the 14 bits represent the symbols within the slot.
For twoSlots, if ECP is configured, the first 12 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 12 bits represent the symbols in the second slot and the last four bits within the bit string are ignored by the UE; Otherwise, the first 14 bits represent the symbols within the first slot and the next 14 bits represent the symbols in the second slot.
For the bits representing symbols in a slot, the most significant bit of the bit string represents the first symbol in the slot and the second most significant bit represents the second symbol in the slot and so on.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
CellLevel
The field is mandatory present if the RateMatchPattern is defined on cell level. The field is absent when the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level or defined for MBS broadcast CFR. If the RateMatchPattern is defined on BWP level, the UE applies the SCS of the BWP and if RateMatchPattern is defined for MBS broadcast CFR, the UE applies the SCS of the initial BWP or RedCap-specific initial BWP (if configured) for RedCap UEs.

ReferenceTimeInfo field descriptions
referenceSFN
This field indicates the reference SFN corresponding to the reference time information. If referenceTimeInfo field is received in DLInformationTransfer message, this field indicates the SFN of PCell.
time
This field indicates time reference with 10ns granularity. If included in DLInformationTransfer and if UE-side TA PDC is de-activated, the indicated time may not be referenced at the network, i.e., gNB may pre-compensate for RF propagation delay. If included in DLInformationTransfer and if UE is requested to transmit UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement, the indicated time may not be referenced at the network, i.e., gNB may pre-compensate for RF propagation delay. Otherwise, the indicated time is referenced at the network, i.e., without compensating for RF propagation delay.
The indicated time in 10ns unit from the origin is refDays*86400*1000*100000 + refSeconds*1000*100000 + refMilliSeconds*100000 + refTenNanoSeconds. The refDays field specifies the sequential number of days (with day count starting at 0) from the origin of the time field.
If the referenceTimeInfo field is received in DLInformationTransfer message, the time field indicates the time at the ending boundary of the system frame indicated by referenceSFN. The UE considers this frame (indicated by referenceSFN) to be the frame which is nearest to the frame where the message is received (which can be either in the past or in the future).
If the referenceTimeInfo field is received in SIB9, the time field indicates the time at the SFN boundary at or immediately after the ending boundary of the SI-window in which SIB9 is transmitted.
If referenceTimeInfo field is received in SIB9, this field is excluded when determining changes in system information, i.e. changes of time should neither result in system information change notifications nor in a modification of valueTag in SIB1.
timeInfoType
If timeInfoType is not included, the time indicates the GPS time and the origin of the time field is 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 6 January, 1980 (start of GPS time). If timeInfoType is set to localClock, the origin of the time is unspecified.
uncertainty
This field indicates the uncertainty of the reference time information provided by the time field. The uncertainty is 25ns multiplied by this field. If this field is absent, the uncertainty is unspecified.

RepetitionSchemeConfig field descriptions
fdm-TDM
Configures UE with a repetition scheme among fdmSchemeA, fdmSchemeB and tdmSchemeA as specified in clause 5.1 of TS 38.214 [19]. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release slotBased if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
sequenceOffsetForRV
For slot-based repetition scheme, selected RV sequence is applied to transmission occasions associated to the first TCI state. The RV sequence associated to the second TCI state is determined by a RV offset from that selected RV sequence.
slotBased
Configures UE with slot-based repetition scheme. Network always configures this field when the parameter repetitionNumber is present in IE PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList. The network does not set this field to release. Upon reception of this field in RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16, the UE shall release fdm-TDM if previously configured in the same instance of RepetitionSchemeConfig-r16.
startingSymbolOffsetK
The starting symbol of the second transmission occasion has K symbol offset relative to the last symbol of the first transmission occasion. When UE is configured with tdmSchemeA, the parameter startingSymbolOffsetK is present, otherwise absent.

ReportConfigInterRAT field descriptions
reportType
Type of the configured measurement report. In (NG)EN-DC, and NR-DC, network does not configure report of type ReportCGI-EUTRA for SCG.

ReportCGI-EUTRA field descriptions
useAutonomousGaps
Indicates whether or not the UE is allowed to use autonomous gaps in acquiring system information from the E-UTRAN neighbour cell. When the field is included, the UE applies the corresponding value for T321.

EventTriggerConfigInterRAT field descriptions
b2-Threshold1
NR threshold to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event B2.
bN-ThresholdEUTRA
E-UTRA threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSRP, RSRQ, SINR) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN. In the same eventB2, the network configures the same CHOICE name (rsrp, rsrq or sinr) for the MeasTriggerQuantity of the b2-Threshold1 and for the MeasTriggerQuantityEUTRA of the b2-Threshold2EUTRA.
eventId
Choice of inter RAT event triggered reporting criteria.
maxReportCells
Max number of non-serving cells/candidate L2 U2N Relay UEs to include in the measurement report.
reportAmount
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types
reportOnLeave
Indicates whether or not the UE shall initiate the measurement reporting procedure when the leaving condition is met for a cell in cellsTriggeredList, as specified in 5.5.4.1.
reportQuantity, reportQuantityUTRA-FDD
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report. If the field eventB1-UTRA-FDD or eventB2-UTRA-FDD is present, the UE shall ignore the value(s) provided in reportQuantity.
reportQuantityRelay
The L2 U2N Relay UE measurement quantity to be included in measuremet report.
timeToTrigger
Time during which specific criteria for the event needs to be met in order to trigger a measurement report.
bN-ThresholdUTRA-FDD
UTRA-FDD threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (RSCP, EcN0) to be used in inter RAT measurement report triggering condition for event number bN.
utra-FDD-RSCP corresponds to CPICH_RSCP in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD. utra-FDD-EcN0 corresponds to CPICH_Ec/No in TS 25.133 [46] for FDD.
For utra-FDD-RSCP: The actual value is field value – 115 dBm.
For utra-FDD-EcN0: The actual value is (field value – 49)/2 dB.
y1-Threshold1
NR threshold to be used in measurement report triggering condition for event Y1.
yN-Threshold2-Relay
L2 U2N Relay threshold value associated with the selected trigger quantity (i.e. RSRP) to be used in measurement report triggering condition for event number YN.

PeriodicalReportConfigInterRAT field descriptions
maxReportCells
Max number of non-serving cells/candidate L2 U2N Relay UEs to include in the measurement report.
reportAmount
Number of measurement reports applicable for eventTriggered as well as for periodical report types
reportQuantity, reportQuantityUTRA-FDD
The cell measurement quantities to be included in the measurement report. If the field reportQuantityUTRA-FDD is present, the UE shall ignore the value(s) provided in reportQuantity.

–	ReportConfigNR
The IE ReportConfigNR specifies criteria for triggering of an NR measurement reporting event or of a CHO, CPA or CPC event or of an L2 U2N relay measurement reporting event. For events labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and so on, measurement reporting events and CHO, CPA or CPC events are based on cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS.
Event A1:	Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A2:	Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;
Event A3:	Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
Event A4:	Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A5:	PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event A6:	Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell;
Event D1:	Distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation1 becomes larger than configured threshold distanceThreshFromReference1 and distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation2 becomes shorter than configured threshold distanceThreshFromReference2;
CondEvent A3: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
CondEvent A4: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than absolute threshold;
CondEvent A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
CondEvent D1: Distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation1 becomes larger than configured threshold distanceThreshFromReference1 and distance between UE and a reference location referenceLocation2 of conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes shorter than configured threshold distanceThreshFromReference2;
CondEvent T1: Time measured at UE becomes more than configured threshold t1-Threshold but is less than t1-Threshold + duration;
Event X1:	Serving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND NR Cell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event X2:	Serving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold;
For event I1, measurement reporting event is based on CLI measurement results, which can either be derived based on SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI.
Event I1:	Interference becomes higher than absolute threshold.

RLC-BearerConfig field descriptions
isPTM-Entity
If configured, indicates that the RLC entity is used for PTM reception. When the field is absent the RLC entity is used for PTP transmission/reception.
logicalChannelIdentity
ID used commonly for the MAC logical channel and for the RLC bearer. Value 4 is not configured for DRBs if SRB4 is configured.
logicalChannelIdentityExt
Extended logical channel ID used commonly for the MAC logical channel and for the RLC bearer for PTM reception. If this field is configured, the UE shall ignore logicalChannelIdentity.
reestablishRLC
Indicates that RLC should be re-established. Network sets this to true at least whenever the security key used for the radio bearer associated with this RLC entity changes. For SRB2, multicast MRBs and DRBs, unless full configuration is used, it is also set to true during the resumption of the RRC connection or the first reconfiguration after reestablishment. For SRB1, when resuming an RRC connection, or at the first reconfiguration after RRC connection reestablishment, the network does not set this field to true.
rlc-Config
Determines the RLC mode (UM, AM) and provides corresponding parameters. RLC mode reconfiguration can only be performed by DRB/multicast MRB release/addition or full configuration. The network may configure rlc-Config-v1610 only when rlc-Config (without suffix) is set to am.
servedMBS-RadioBearer
Associates the RLC Bearer with a multicast MRB. The UE shall deliver DL RLC SDUs received via the RLC entity of this RLC bearer to the PDCP entity of the servedMBS-RadioBearer.
servedRadioBearer, servedRadioBearerSRB4
Associates the RLC Bearer with an SRB or a DRB. The UE shall deliver DL RLC SDUs received via the RLC entity of this RLC bearer to the PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer. Furthermore, the UE shall advertise and deliver uplink PDCP PDUs of the uplink PDCP entity of the servedRadioBearer to the uplink RLC entity of this RLC bearer unless the uplink scheduling restrictions (moreThanOneRLC in PDCP-Config and the restrictions in LogicalChannelConfig) forbid it to do so.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
LCH-Setup
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a DRB or a multicast MRB or SRB4. This field is optionally present, Need S, upon creation of a new logical channel for an SRB except SRB4. It is optionally present, Need M, otherwise.
LCH-SetupModMRB
This field is optionally present upon creation of a new logical channel for PTM reception for a multicast MRB. If this field is included upon creation of a new logical channel for PTM reception for a multicast MRB, it shall be present when modifying this logical channel. The field is absent for logical channels configured for an SRB and a DRB.
LCH-SetupOnly
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a DRB or an SRB (servedRadioBearer). It is absent, Need M otherwise.
LCH-SetupOnlyMRB
This field is mandatory present upon creation of a new logical channel for a multicast MRB and upon modification of MRB-Identity of the served MRB. It is absent, Need M otherwise.

SearchSpace field descriptions
common
Configures this search space as common search space (CSS) and DCI formats to monitor.
controlResourceSetId
The CORESET applicable for this SearchSpace. Value 0 identifies the common CORESET#0 configured in MIB and in ServingCellConfigCommon. Values 1..maxNrofControlResourceSets-1 identify CORESETs configured in System Information or by dedicated signalling. The CORESETs with non-zero controlResourceSetId are configured in the same BWP as this SearchSpace except commonControlResourceSetExt which is configured by SIB20. If the field controlResourceSetId-r16 is present, UE shall ignore the controlResourceSetId (without suffix).
dummy1, dummy2
This field is not used in the specification. If received it shall be ignored by the UE.
dci-Format0-0-AndFormat1-0

If duration-r17 is absent, the UE assumes the duration in slots is equal to L. The maximum valid duration is periodicity-L.

For IAB-MT, duration indicates number of consecutive slots that a SearchSpace lasts in every occasion, i.e., upon every period as given in the periodicityAndOffset. If the field is absent, the IAB-MT applies the value 1 slot, except for DCI format 2_0 and DCI format 2_5. The IAB-MT ignores this field for DCI format 2_0 and DCI format 2_5. The maximum valid duration is periodicity-1 (periodicity as given in the monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset).
freqMonitorLocations
Defines an association of the search space to multiple monitoring locations in the frequency domain and indicates whether the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is replicated to a specific RB set, see TS 38.213, clause 10.1. Each bit in the bitmap corresponds to one RB set, and the leftmost (most significant) bit corresponds to RB set 0 in the BWP. A bit set to 1 indicates that a frequency domain resource allocation replicated from the pattern configured in the associated CORESET is mapped to the RB set.
monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset
Slots for PDCCH Monitoring configured as periodicity and offset.
For SCS 15, 30, 60, and 120 kHz and if the UE is configured to monitor:

- DCI format 2_4, only the values 'sl8', 'sl16', 'sl32', 'sl40', 'sl64', 'sl80' are applicable.

For SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz, and the configured periodicity and offset are restricted to be an integer multiple of L slots, where L is the configured length of the bitmap provided by monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup-r17, i.e. for a given periodicity, the offset has a range of {0, L, 2*L, …, L*FLOOR(1/L*(periodicity-1))}.

For IAB-MT, If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_1, only the values 'sl1', 'sl2' or 'sl4' are applicable. If the IAB-MT is configured to monitor DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, only the values ′sl1′, ′sl2′, ′sl4′, ′sl5′, ′sl8′, ′sl10′, ′sl16′, and ′sl20′ are applicable (see TS 38.213, clause 10).
If monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 is present, any previously configured monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset is released, and if monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset is present, any previously configured monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset-r17 is released.
monitoringSlotsWithinSlotGroup
Indicates which slot(s) within a slot group are configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring. The first (leftmost, most significant) bit represents the first slot in the slot group, the second bit represents the second slot in the slot group, and so on. A bit set to '1' indicates that the corresponding slot is configured for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10). The number of slots for multi-slot PDCCH monitoring is configured according to clause 10 in TS 38.213 [13].
monitoringSymbolsWithinSlot
The first symbol(s) for PDCCH monitoring in the slots configured for (multi-slot) PDCCH monitoring (see monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset and duration). The most significant (left) bit represents the first OFDM in a slot, and the second most significant (left) bit represents the second OFDM symbol in a slot and so on. The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT.
For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 1 symbol.
See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
For IAB-MT: For DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, the first one symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE ControlResourceSet) identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 2 symbols, and the first three symbols apply if the duration of CORESET identified by controlResourceSetId indicates 1 symbol.
See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.
nrofCandidates-CI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-4 for the configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10.1).
nrofCandidates-PEI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-7 for the configured aggregation level.
nrofCandidates-SFI
The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-0 for the configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.1). For a search space configured with freqMonitorLocations-r16, only value ′n1′ is valid.
nrofCandidates
Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific value is provided (see inside searchSpaceType). If configured in the SearchSpace of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 10).
searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16, searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17
List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0 or 1 if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16 is included. The network configures at most 3 search space groups per BWP where the group ID is either 0, 1 or 2 if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 is included. And if searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17 is included, searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16 is ignored.
searchSpaceId
Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the searchSpaceZero configured via PBCH (MIB) or ServingCellConfigCommon and may hence not be used in the SearchSpace IE. The searchSpaceId is unique among the BWPs of a Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces with the same searchSpaceId in scheduled cell and scheduling cell are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both active.
For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT where each search space is associated with one ControlResearchSet and for a scheduled cell in the case of cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the optional fields are absent.
SearchSpaceLinkingId
This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type in the same BWP. If two search spaces have the same SearchSpaceLinkingId UE assumes these search spaces are linked to PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of one SS set is linked to n-th monitoring occasion of the other SS set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, searchSpaceSIB1, searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation, pagingSearchSpace, ra-SearchSpace, searchSpaceMCCH, searchSpaceMTCH, peiSearchSpace, and sdt-SearchSpace. SS set configured by recoverySearchSpaceId cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked.
This parameter is not applicable to search space configured with dci-FormatsSL for monitoring format 3-0 or format 3-1 or for monitoring formats 3-0 and format 3-1.
searchSpaceType
Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for.
ue-Specific
Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS). The UE monitors the DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI (if configured), and SP-CSI-RNTI (if configured)

ChannelAccessConfig field descriptions
absenceOfAnyOtherTechnology
Presence of this field indicates absence on a long term basis (e.g. by level of regulation) of any other technology sharing the carrier; absence of this field indicates the potential presence of any other technology sharing the carrier, as specified in TS 37.213 [48] clauses 4.2.1 and 4.2.3.
energyDetectionConfig
Indicates whether to use the maxEnergyDetectionThreshold or the energyDetectionThresholdOffset (see TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.2.3).
energyDetectionThresholdOffset
Indicates the offset to the default maximum energy detection threshold value. Unit in dB. Value -13 corresponds to -13dB, value -12 corresponds to -12dB, and so on (i.e. in steps of 1dB) as specified in TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.2.3.
maxEnergyDetectionThreshold
Indicates the absolute maximum energy detection threshold value. Unit in dBm. Value -85 corresponds to -85 dBm, value -84 corresponds to -84 dBm, and so on (i.e. in steps of 1dBm) as specified in TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.2.3.
ul-toDL-COT-SharingED-Threshold
Maximum energy detection threshold that the UE should use to share channel occupancy with gNB for DL transmission as specified in TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.1.3 for downlink channel access and clause 4.2.3 for uplink channel access. This field is not applicable in semi-static channel access mode.

ServingCellConfig field descriptions
additionalPCI-ToAddModList
List of information for the additional SSB with different PCI than the serving cell PCI. The additional SSBs with different PCIs are not used for serving cell quality derivation.
bwp-InactivityTimer
The duration in ms after which the UE falls back to the default Bandwidth Part (see TS 38.321 [3], clause 5.15). When the network releases the timer configuration, the UE stops the timer without switching to the default BWP.
ca-SlotOffset
Slot offset between the primary cell (PCell/PSCell) and the SCell in unaligned frame boundary with slot alignment and partial SFN alignment inter-band CA. Based on this field, the UE determines the time offset of the SCell as specified in clause 4.5 of TS 38.211 [16]. The granularity of this field is determined by the reference SCS for the slot offset (i.e. the maximum of PCell/PSCell lowest SCS among all the configured SCSs in DL/UL SCS-SpecificCarrierList in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB and this serving cell's lowest SCS among all the configured SCSs in DL/UL SCS-SpecificCarrierList in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB).
The Network configures at most single non-zero offset duration in ms (independent on SCS) among CCs in the unaligned CA configuration. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value of 0. The slot offset value can only be changed with SCell release and add.
cbg-TxDiffTBsProcessingType1, cbg-TxDiffTBsProcessingType2
Indicates whether processing types 1 and 2 based CBG based operation is enabled according to Rel-16 UE capabilities.
channelAccessConfig
List of parameters used for access procedures of operation with shared spectrum channel access (see TS 37.213 [48).
channelAccessMode2
If present, this field indicates that the UE shall apply channel access procedures for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4 for FR2-2. If absent, the UE does not apply these channel access procedures. The network always configures this field if channel access procedures are required for the serving cell within this region by regulations.
Overwrites the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommon or ServingCellConfigCommonSIB for this serving cell.
crossCarrierSchedulingConfig
Indicates whether this serving cell is cross-carrier scheduled by another serving cell or whether it cross-carrier schedules another serving cell.

If the field is absent for the PSCell at SCG deactivation, the UE considers the previously activated DL BWP as the BWP to be used for RLM, BFD and measurements. If the field is absent for the PSCell at SCG activation, the DL BWP to be activated is the DL BWP previously to be used for RLM, BFD and measurements.
If configured for an SCell, this field contains the ID of the downlink bandwidth part to be used upon activation of an SCell. The initial bandwidth part is referred to by BWP-Id = 0.

If the field is included, it replaces any previous list, i.e. all the entries of the list are replaced and each of the LTE-NeighCellsCRS-AssistInfo entries is considered to be newly created and the conditions and Need codes for setup of the entry apply.
lte-NeighCellsCRS-Assumptions
If the field is not configured, the following default network configuration assumptions are valid for all LTE neighbour cells for the purpose of CRS interference mitigation (CRS-IM) in scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR (see TS 38.101-4 [59]).
-	The CRS port number is the same as the one indicated in RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS if configured for the serving cell.
-	The CRS port number is 4 if RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS is not configured for the serving cell.
-	The channel bandwidth and centre frequency are the same as the ones indicated in RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS if configured for the serving cell.
-	The MBSFN configuration is the same as the one indicated in RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS if configured for the serving cell. If RateMatchPatternLTE-CRS is not configured for the serving cell, MBSFN subframe is not configured.

ServingCellConfigCommon field descriptions
channelAccessMode
If present, this field indicates which channel access procedures to apply for operation with shared spectrum channel access as defined in TS 37.213 [48]. If the field is configured as "semiStatic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures for semi-static channel occupancy as described in clause 4.3 in TS 37.213. If the field is configured as "dynamic", the UE shall apply the channel access procedures as defined in TS 37.213, clause 4.1 and 4.2.
channelAccessMode2
If present, the UE shall apply channel access procedures for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4 for FR2-2. If absent, the UE shall not apply any channel access procedure. The network always configures this field if channel access procedures are required for the serving cell within this region by regulations.
dmrs-TypeA-Position
Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause 7.4.1.1.1) and uplink (TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3).
downlinkConfigCommon
The common downlink configuration of the serving cell, including the frequency information configuration and the initial downlink BWP common configuration. The parameters provided herein should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) of the serving cell, with the exception of controlResourceSetZero and searchSpaceZero which can be configured in ServingCellConfigCommon even if MIB indicates that they are absent.
discoveryBurstWindowLength
Indicates the window length of the discovery burst in ms (see TS 37.213 [48]). The field discoveryBurstWindowLength-r17 is applicable to SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz.
featurePriorities
Indicates priorities for features, such as RedCap, Slicing, SDT and MSG3-Repetitions for Coverage Enhancements. These priorities are used to determine which FeatureCombinationPreambles the UE shall use when a feature maps to more than one FeatureCombinationPreambles, as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. A lower value means a higher priority. The network does not signal the same priority for more than one feature. The network signals a priority for all feature that map to at least one FeatureCombinationPreambles.
longBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 64 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
lte-CRS-ToMatchAround
Parameters to determine an LTE CRS pattern that the UE shall rate match around.
mediumBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 8 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
n-TimingAdvanceOffset
The N_TA-Offset to be applied for all uplink transmissions on this serving cell. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value defined for the duplex mode and frequency range of this serving cell. See TS 38.133 [14], table 7.1.2-2.
ra-ChannelAccess
If present, this field indicates that the UE shall apply channel access procedures before msg1/msgA transmission for operation with shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], clause 4.4.5 for FR2-2.
rateMatchPatternToAddModList
Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around. The UE rate matches around the union of all resources indicated in the rate match patterns. Rate match patterns defined here on cell level apply only to PDSCH of the same numerology (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 5.1.4.1). If a RateMatchPattern with the same RateMatchPatternId is configured in both ServingCellConfig/ServingCellConfigCommon and in SIB20/MCCH, the entire RateMatchPattern configuration, including the set of RBs/REs indicated by the patterns for the rate matching around, shall be the same and they are counted as a single rate match pattern in the total configured rate match patterns as defined in TS 38.214 [19].
shortBitmap
Bitmap when maximum number of SS/PBCH blocks per half frame equals to 4 as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ss-PBCH-BlockPower
Average EPRE of the resources elements that carry secondary synchronization signals in dBm that the NW used for SSB transmission, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 7.
ssb-periodicityServingCell
The SSB periodicity in ms for the rate matching purpose. If the field is absent, the UE applies the value ms5. (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1)
ssb-PositionQCL
Indicates the QCL relation between SSB positions for this serving cell as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.
ssb-PositionsInBurst
For operation in licensed spectrum, indicates the time domain positions of the transmitted SS-blocks in a half frame with SS/PBCH blocks as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. The first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not transmitted while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is transmitted. The network configures the same pattern in this field as in the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by ssb-PositionsInBurst may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block indexes provided by ssb-PositionsInBurst (see TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1). If the k-th bit of ssb-PositionsInBurst is set to 1, the UE assumes that one or more SS/PBCH blocks within the discovery burst transmission window with candidate SS/PBCH block indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH block index equal to k – 1 may be transmitted; if the kt-th bit is set to 0, the UE assumes that the corresponding SS/PBCH block(s) are not transmitted. The k-th bit is set to 0, where k > ssb-PositionQCL and the number of actually transmitted SS/PBCH blocks is not larger than the number of 1's in the bitmap. The network configures the same pattern in this field as in the corresponding field in ServingCellConfigCommonSIB. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, only mediumBitmap is used, and for FR2-2, longBitmap is used.
ssbSubcarrierSpacing
Subcarrier spacing of SSB.
Only the following values are applicable depending on the used frequency:
FR1:   15 or 30 kHz
FR2-1:  120 or 240 kHz
FR2-2:  120, 480, or 960 kHz
supplementaryUplinkConfig
The network configures this field only if uplinkConfigCommon is configured. If this field is absent, the UE shall release the supplementaryUplinkConfig and the supplementaryUplink configured in ServingCellConfig of this serving cell, if configured.
tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon
A cell-specific TDD UL/DL configuration, see TS 38.213 [13], clause 11.1.

SchedulingInfo field descriptions
areaScope
Indicates that a SIB is area specific. If the field is absent, the SIB is cell specific.
si-BroadcastStatus
Indicates if the SI message is being broadcasted or not. Change of si-BroadcastStatus should not result in system information change notifications in Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5). The value of the indication is valid until the end of the BCCH modification period when set to broadcasting. When SIB19 is scheduled, the si-BroadcastStatus for the mapped SIB19 is set to broadcasting.
If si-SchedulingInfo-v1700 is present, the network ensures that the total number of SI messages with si-BroadcastStatus set to notBroadcasting in the list of concatenated SI messages configured by schedulingInfoList in si-SchedulingInfo and SI messages containing type1 SIB configured by schedulingInfoList2 in si-SchedulingInfo-v1700 does not exceed the limit of maxSI-Message when si-RequestConfig, si-RequestConfigRedCap or si-RequestConfigSUL is configured.
si-Periodicity
Periodicity of the SI-message in radio frames. Value rf8 corresponds to 8 radio frames, value rf16 corresponds to 16 radio frames, and so on.

SI-SchedulingInfo field descriptions
dummy
This field is not used in this specification. If received, it is ignored by the UE.
si-RequestConfig
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
si-RequestConfigRedCap
Configuration of Msg1 resources for initialUplinkBWP-RedCap that the RedCap UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
si-RequestConfigSUL
Configuration of Msg1 resources that the UE uses for requesting SI-messages for which si-BroadcastStatus is set to notBroadcasting.
si-WindowLength
The length of the SI scheduling window. Value s5 corresponds to 5 slots, value s10 corresponds to 10 slots and so on. The network always configures si-WindowLength to be shorter than or equal to the si-Periodicity. The values s2560-v1710 and s5120-v1710 are only applicable for SCS 480 kHz.
systemInformationAreaID
Indicates the system information area that the cell belongs to, if any. Any SIB with areaScope within the SI is considered to belong to this systemInformationAreaID. The systemInformationAreaID is unique within a PLMN/SNPN.

SchedulingInfo2 field descriptions
encrypted
The presence of this field indicates that the pos-sib-type is encrypted as specified in TS 37.355 [49].

sbas-id
The presence of this field indicates that the positioning SIB type is for a specific SBAS. Indicates a specific SBAS (see also TS 37.355 [49]).
si-WindowPosition
This field indicates the SI window position of the associated SI-message. The network provides si-WindowPosition in an ascending order, i.e. si-WindowPosition in the subsequent entry in schedulingInfoList2 has always value higher than in the previous entry of schedulingInfoList2. The network configures this field in a way that ensures that SI messages scheduled by schedulingInfoList and/or posSchedulingInfoList do not overlap with SI messages scheduled by schedulingInfoList2.
sib-MappingInfo
Indicates which SIBs or posSIBs are contained in the SI message.
sibType
The type of SIB(s) mapped to SI for scheduling using schedulingInfoList2. Value type1 indicates SIBs and value type2 indicates posSIBs.

When this RRC parameter is configured, start RB location hopping is enabled for partial frequency sounding in different SRS frequency hopping periods for periodic/semi-persistent/aperiodic SRS as described in Clause 6.4.1.4 in TS 38.211.
freqHopping
Includes parameters capturing SRS frequency hopping (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this field such that b-hop > b-SRS.
groupOrSequenceHopping
Parameter(s) for configuring group or sequence hopping (see TS 38.211 [16], clause  6.4.1.4.2). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this parameter to 'neither'.
nrofSRS-Ports
Number of ports. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures this parameter to 'port1'.
periodicityAndOffset-p, periodicityAndOffset-p-Ext
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sl1 corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sl2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sl1 the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, sl1280 and sl2560 cannot be configured. For SRS-PosResource, values sl20480, sl40960 and sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=15kHz, values sl40960 and sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=30kHz, and value sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=60kHz.
When periodicityAndOffset-p-Ext is present, periodicityAndOffset-p shall be ignored by the UE.
periodicityAndOffset-sp, periodicityAndOffset-sp-Ext
Periodicity and slot offset for this SRS resource. All values are in "number of slots". Value sl1 corresponds to a periodicity of 1 slot, value sl2 corresponds to a periodicity of 2 slots, and so on. For each periodicity the corresponding offset is given in number of slots. For periodicity sl1 the offset is 0 slots (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For SRS-PosResource, values sl20480, sl40960 and sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=15kHz, values sl40960 and sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=30kHz, and value sl81920 cannot be configured for SCS=60kHz.
When periodicityAndOffset-sp-Ext is present, periodicityAndOffset-sp shall be ignored by the UE.
ptrs-PortIndex
The PTRS port index for this SRS resource for non-codebook based UL MIMO. This is only applicable when the corresponding PTRS-UplinkConfig is set to CP-OFDM. The ptrs-PortIndex configured here must be smaller than the maxNrofPorts configured in the PTRS-UplinkConfig (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.3.1). This parameter is not applicable to CLI SRS-RSRP measurement.

The configured SRS resource does not exceed the slot boundary. If resourceMapping-r16 is signalled, UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix). If resourceMapping-r17 is signalled, resourceMapping-r16 is not signalled and the UE shall ignore the resourceMapping (without suffix) and only the values of nrofSymbols which are integer multiples of the configured repetitionFactor can be configured. The network can only signal repetitionFactor-v1730 if resourceMapping-r17 is signalled. When repetitionFactor-v1730 is signalled, the UE shall ignore repetitionFactor-r17. For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, the network always configures nrofSymbols and repetitionFactor to 'n1'.
resourceType
Periodicity and offset for semi-persistent and periodic SRS resource, or slot offset for aperiodic SRS resource for positioning (see TS 38.214 [19], clause 6.2.1). For CLI SRS-RSRP measurement, only 'periodic' is applicable for resourceType.

UplinkTxDirectCurrentMoreCarrierList and CC-Group field descriptions
CC-Group
The contiguous carriers sharing the same PA in an intra-band UL CA configuration. The UE shall report only one DC location for an intra-band CC combination with one active uplink carrier in case DefaultDC-Location is set to activeCarrier or activeBWP.
defaultDC-Location
Indicates the default DC location derivation option. The default Tx Direct Current is located at the mathematical center of the UE bandwidth, i.e. between the lower edge of the lowest subcarrier of the lowest frequency component and the upper edge of the highest subcarrier of the highest frequency component, rounded to the subcarrier grid of the lowest SCS defined for the component carrier on which the default Direct Current is located. The lowest and highest frequency components used for derivation of mathematical center are indicated by FrequencyComponent in the associated CC-Group, where the lowest frequency component and the highest frequency component may be the same. If the mathematical center of the UE bandwidth lands on frequencies where there is no subcarrier grid defined, the subcarrier grid of the lowest SCS of the nearest lower frequency component carrier shall be extended to cover the frequency of the mathematical default Direct Current location.
offsetToDefault
Indicates the DC location offset to the default DC location derived from defaultDC-Location. The lowest SCS in the CC group is used as the offset granularity. Value 0 respresents no offset.
offsetValue is used in case DefaultDC-Location is set to configuredCarrier or configuredBWP. offsetlist is used in case DefaultDC-Location is set to activeCarrier or activeBWP. Each entity in this list corresponds to the entry in carriers combination in IntraBandCC-CombinationReqList of the intra-band CA component. For each CC group, the UE shall include the same number of entries, and listed in the same order as in CC-CombinationList. If DefaultDC-Location is set the activeCarrier, same offsetValue is signalled for all requested carriers combinations with same active carriers states(regardless of the active BWP index).
servCellIndexHigher
Indicates the serving cell index of the highest edge of the CC-Group. If asbsent, there is only one carrier in this group indicated by servCellIndexLower.
servCellIndexLower
Indicates the serving cell index of the lowest edge of the CC-Group.
shift7dot5kHz
Indicates whether there is 7.5 kHz shift or not. 7.5 kHz shift is applied if the field is set to true, otherwise 7.5 kHz shift is not applied.

DefaultDC-Location field descriptions
dl
Indicates that the default DC location is derived based on the DL frequencies of the frequency component.
ul
Indicates that the default DC location is derived based on the UL frequencies of the frequency component.

CodebookParameters field descriptions
supportedCSI-RS-ResourceListAlt
This field indicates the alternative list of SupportedCSI-RS-Resource supported for each codebook type. The supported CSI-RS resource is indicated by an integer value which pinpoints SupportedCSI-RS-Resource defined in CodebookVariantsList. The value 0 corresponds to the first entry of CodebookVariantsList. The value 1 corresponds to the second entry of CodebookVariantsList, and so on. For each codebook type, the field shall be included in both codebookParametersPerBC (but optional for single CC) and codebookParametersPerBand.

–	FeatureSetCombination
The IE FeatureSetCombination is a two-dimensional matrix of FeatureSet entries.
Each FeatureSetsPerBand contains a list of feature sets applicable to the carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand. All FeatureSetsPerBand in one FeatureSetCombination must have the same number of entries.
The number of FeatureSetsPerBand in the FeatureSetCombination must be equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The first FeatureSetPerBand applies to the first band entry of the band combination, and so on.
Each FeatureSet contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for UL and DL.
In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the FeatureSets IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position in the featureSetsUplink / featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSet IE.
In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the UE-EUTRA-Capability container.
The FeatureSetUplink and FeatureSetDownlink referred to from the FeatureSet comprise, among other information, a set of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids and FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids. The number of these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the bandwidth class indicated in the associated BandCombination, if present.
In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or lower capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.
NOTE 1:	The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band contiguous fallback). Or by separate BandCombination entries with associated FeatureSetCombinations.
NOTE 2:	The UE may advertise a FeatureSetCombination containing only fallback band combinations. That means, in a FeatureSetCombination, each group of FeatureSets across the bands may contain at least one pair of FeatureSetUplinkId and FeatureSetDownlinkId which is set to 0/0.
NOTE 3:	The Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration to comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

–	FeatureSetCombinationId
The IE FeatureSetCombinationId identifies a FeatureSetCombination. The FeatureSetCombinationId of a FeatureSetCombination is the position of the FeatureSetCombination in the featureSetCombinations list (in UE-NR-Capability or UE-MRDC-Capability). The FeatureSetCombinationId = 0 refers to the first entry in the featureSetCombinations list (in UE-NR-Capability or UE-MRDC-Capability).
NOTE:	The FeatureSetCombinationId = 1024 is not used due to the maximum entry number of featureSetCombinations.

FeatureSetDownlink field descriptions
featureSetListPerDownlinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual DL carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refer to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassDL, except if indicating additional functionality by reducing the number of FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in the feature set (see NOTE 1 in FeatureSetCombination IE description). The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Id in this list.
supportedSRS-Resources
Indicates supported SRS resources for SRS carrier switching to the band associated with this FeatureSetDownlink. The UE is only allowed to set this field for a band with associated FeatureSetUplinkId set to 0.

–	FeatureSetDownlinkId
The IE FeatureSetDownlinkId identifies a downlink feature set. The FeatureSetDownlinkId of a FeatureSetDownlink is the index position of the FeatureSetDownlink in the featureSetsDownlink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in that list is referred to by FeatureSetDownlinkId = 1. The FeatureSetDownlinkId=0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetDownlink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

–	FeatureSets
The IE FeatureSets is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink features sets. A FeatureSetCombination refers to the IDs of the feature set(s) that the UE supports in that FeatureSetCombination. The BandCombination entries in the BandCombinationList then indicate the ID of the FeatureSetCombination that the UE supports for that band combination.
The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position. For example, the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id = 4 identifies the 4th element in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC list.
NOTE:	When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of the specification, new versions of the FeatureSetDownlink, FeatureSetUplink, FeatureSets, FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC and/or FeatureSetUplinkPerCC will be created and instantiated in corresponding new lists in the FeatureSets IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be added to the FeatureSetDownlink, they will instead be defined in a new FeatureSetDownlink-rxy which will be instantiated in a new featureSetDownlinkList-rxy list. If a UE indicates in a FeatureSetCombination that it supports the FeatureSetDownlink with ID #5, it implies that it supports both the features in FeatureSetDownlink #5 and FeatureSetDownlink-rxy #5 (if present). The number of entries in the new list(s) shall be the same as in the original list(s).

FeatureSetUplink field descriptions
featureSetListPerUplinkCC
Indicates which features the UE supports on the individual UL carriers of the feature set (and hence of a band entry that refers to the feature set). The UE shall hence include at least as many FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list as the number of carriers it supports according to the ca-BandwidthClassUL, except if indicating additional functionality by reducing the number of FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in the feature set (see NOTE 1 in FeatureSetCombination IE description). The order of the elements in this list is not relevant, i.e., the network may configure any of the carriers in accordance with any of the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id in this list.

–	FeatureSetUplinkId
The IE FeatureSetUplinkId identifies an uplink feature set. The FeatureSetUplinkId of a FeatureSetUplink is the index position of the FeatureSetUplink in the featureSetsUplink list in the FeatureSets IE. The first element in the list is referred to by FeatureSetUplinkId = 1, and so on. The FeatureSetUplinkId =0 is not used by an actual FeatureSetUplink but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band combination.

UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon field descriptions
codebookTypeRequest
Only if this field is present, the UE includes SupportedCSI-RS-Resource supported for the codebook type(s) requested within this field (i.e. type I single/multi-panel, type II and type II port selection) into codebookVariantsList, codebookParametersPerBand and codebookParametersPerBC. If this field is present and none of the codebook types is requested within this field (i.e. empty field), the UE includes SupportedCSI-RS-Resource supported for all codebook types into codebookVariantsList, codebookParametersPerBand and codebookParametersPerBC.
fallbackGroupFiveRequest
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting FR2 CA bandwidth class from fallback group 5 shall include band combinations with FR2 CA bandwidth class from fallback group 5, and shall omit band combinations with FR2 CA bandwidth class from fallback group 2 or 3 (see TS 38.101-2 [39]) with same or lower capabilities.
includeNE-DC
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting NE-DC shall indicate support for NE-DC in band combinations and include feature set combinations which are applicable to NE-DC. Band combinations supporting both NE-DC and (NG)EN-DC shall be included in supportedBandCombinationList, band combinations supporting only NE-DC shall be included in supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only.
includeNR-DC
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting NR-DC shall indicate support for NR-DC in band combinations and include feature set combinations which are applicable to NR-DC.
mode
The mode of NR-DC operation that the NW is interested in for this cell grouping. The value sync means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports synchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping. The value async means that the UE only indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports asynchronous NR-DC with the requested cell grouping.
omitEN-DC
Only if this field is present, the UE shall omit band combinations and feature set combinations which are only applicable to (NG)EN-DC.
requestedCellGrouping
The NR-DC cell groupings that the NW is interested in, i.e., the bands that it might use in an MCG and the bands that it might use in an SCG. Only if this field is present, the UE indicates NR-DC support for band combinations for which it supports the requested cell grouping, i.e., in which it supports at least one of the mcg bands on MCG and at least one of the scg bands on the SCG. In its supportedBandCombinationList, the UE indicates which of its NR-DC band combinations supports which of the requested cell groupings. The first element in this list is referred to by ID#0, the second by ID#1 and so on. If this field is absent, the UE only includes band combinations for which it supports NR-DC with only FR1 bands in MCG and only FR2 bands in SCG.
Example 1: requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW would always use CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (depending on which are deployed on a given site) whereas with n78 and/or n261 the NW may need to use DC. With this filter a UE may report a band combination n1A-n7A-n78A for NR-DC only if it supports that serving cells for n1 and n7 are in the MCG and a serving cell for n78 is in the SCG. The UE may also report a band combination n41C-n261M for NR-DC provided that it supports a serving cell for n41 in the MCG and a serving cell for n261 in the SCG.
Example 2: One requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n41, n66] and scg=[n78, n261] and another requestedCellGrouping is set to mcg=[n1, n7, n66] and scg=[ n41, n78, n261]. This assumes that the NW uses sometimes CA among n1, n7, n41 and n66 (as in example 1) and sometimes CA among n1, n7 and n66 but DC towards one or several of n41, n78, n261. If a UE supports n1A-n41A-n78A only if n41A and n78A are in the same cell group, this UE may only indicate cell grouping ID#1 (not #0) in its BC.
uplinkTxSwitchRequest
Only if this field is present, the UE supporting dynamic UL Tx switching shall indicate support for UL Tx switching in band combinations which are applicable to inter-band UL CA, SUL and (NG)EN-DC.

Conditional Presence
Explanation
NRDC
The field is optionally present, Need N, if includeNR-DC is included. It is absent otherwise.

AppLayerMeasConfig field descriptions
measConfigAppLayerContainer
The field contains configuration of application layer measurements, see Annex L (normative) in TS 26.247 [68], clause 16.5 in TS 26.114 [69] and TS 26.118 [70].
pauseReporting
The field indicates whether the transmission of measReportAppLayerContainer is paused or not. Value true indicates the transmission of measReportAppLayerContainer is paused; value false indicates the transmission of measReportAppLayerContainer is not paused.
ran-VisibleParameters
The field indicates whether RAN visible application layer measurements shall be reported or not.
rrc-SegAllowed
This field indicates that RRC segmentation of MeasurementReportAppLayer is allowed. It may be present only if the UE supports RRC segmentation of the MeasurementReportAppLayer message in UL.
serviceType
Indicates the type of application layer measurement. Value streaming indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for streaming services (see TS 26.247 [68]), value mtsi indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for MTSI (see TS 26.114 [69]). value vr indicates Quality of Experience Measurement Collection for VR service (see TS 26.118 [70]). The network always configures serviceType when application layer measurements are initially configured and at fullConfig.
transmissionOfSessionStartStop
The field indicates whether the UE shall transmit indications when sessions in the application layer start and stop. The UE transmits a session start indication upon configuration of this field if a session already has started in the application layer.

RAN-VisibleParameters field descriptions
numberOfBufferLevelEntries
The field contains the maximum number of buffer level entries that can be reported for RAN visible application layer measurements. This field is also used by application layer to calculate the interval of RAN visible buffer level measurement, which is equal to the periodicity of RAN visible application layer measurements reporting divided by numberOfBufferLevelEntries.
ran-VisiblePeriodicity
The field indicates the periodicity of RAN visible application layer measurements reporting. Value ms120 indicates 120 ms, value ms240 indicates 240 ms and so on. If this field is absent, the periodicity of RAN visible application layer reporting is the same as the reporting periodicity indicated in measConfigAppLayerContainer.
reportPlayoutDelayForMediaStartup
The field indicates whether the UE shall report Playout Delay for Media Startup for RAN visible application layer measurements.


Conditional Presence
Explanation
ServiceType
This field is optionally present, Need M, when serviceType is set to streaming or vr. Otherwise, it is absent.

MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowList field descriptions
MTCH-SSB-MappingWindowCycleOffset
Indicates the cycle and offset for MTCH PDCCH ocassions to SSB mapping. Values in unit of ms. ms10 corresponds to cycle of 10 ms with corresponding offset between 0 and 9 ms, value ms20 corresponds to cycle of 20 ms with corresponding offset between 0 and 19 ms, and so on. The mapping window starts at a subframe in a SFN where [(SFN number × 10) + subframe number] modulo (cycle) = offset.
PDCCH monitoring occasions for MTCH in a mapping window which are not overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon) are sequentially numbered starting from 1 in the maping window. The [x×N+K]th PDCCH monitoring occasion for MTCH in this mapping window corresponds to the Kth transmitted SSB, where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, …N, N is the number of actual transmitted SSBs determined according to ssb-PositionsInBurst in SIB1 and X is equal to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MTCH to SSB mapping transmission window/N). The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of their SSB indexes.

8	Protocol data unit abstract syntax
8.1	General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681 [7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [8].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in X.691:
-	When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to 15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
NOTE:	The terms 'leading bit' and 'trailing bit' are defined in ITU-T Rec. X.680. When using the 'bstring' notation, the leading bit of the bit string value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the right.
-	When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint ("CONTAINING"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a separate step;
-	When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU, BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
8.2	Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs (in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
-	when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC SDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
-	upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
8.3	Basic production
The 'basic production' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains a multiple of 8 bits.
8.4	Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall, unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty extensions;
-	A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set spare bits to zero.
8.5	Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of 8.

Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding
9	Specified and default radio configurations
Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the details are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are fixed while default configurations can be modified using dedicated signalling. The default value for the parameters not listed in following clauses shall be set such as the corresponding features are not configured, i.e. release or false unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE:	The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the "default radio configuration" in accordance with this clause.

9.1.2	Void
9.2	Default radio configurations
The following clauses only list default values for REL-15 parameters included in protocol version v15.3.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol version, the default value is "released" or "false" unless explicitly specified otherwise. If the UE is to apply default configuration while it is configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the original version of those fields with only default values.
NOTE 1:	In general, the signalling should preferably support a "release" option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The "value not applicable" should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.
NOTE 2:	For parameters in ServingCellConfig, the default values are specified in the corresponding specification.

10	Generic error handling
10.1	General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent clauses applies unless explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
-	to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer syntax supported by the UE;
-	to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
-	as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
10.2	ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1>	when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH, PCCH, MCCH or a PC5 RRC message on SBCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
2>	ignore the message.
NOTE:	This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message level.
10.3	Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message or PC5 RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	if a default value is defined for this field:
3>	treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2>	else if the concerned field is optional:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the need code for absence of the concerned field;
2>	else:
3>	treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with clause 10.4.
10.4	Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1>	if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field is absent or treated as absent:
2>	if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH; or
2>	if the PC5 RRC message was not received on SCCH:
3>	if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE OF):
4>	treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended field was absent;
3>	else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the 'parent' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the erroneous field:
4>	consider the 'parent' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4>	apply the generic error handling to the subsequent 'parent' field(s), until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3>	else (field at message level):
4>	ignore the message.
NOTE 1:	The error handling defined in these clauses implies that the UE ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended value.
NOTE 2:	The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels other than DCCH, CCCH and SCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the network not observing conditional presence.
NOTE 3:	UE behaviour on receipt of an RRC message on DCCH or CCCH or a PC5 RRC message on SCCH that does not include a field that is mandatory (e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) is unspecified.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested error handling for errors in extension fields.

-- Example with extension addition group

ItemInfoList ::=                    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OFItemInfo

    field2                              Field2                  OPTIONAL,           -- Need N

    nonCriticalExtension                SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL            -- Need S
}

-- ASN1STOP

The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable in case of nested error handling:
-	an extension addition group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than just the extension addition group containing field3 and field4);
-	a traditional nonCriticalExtension is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the conditionality of field3 would result in the entire BroadcastInfoBlock1 to be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing field3 and field4).
10.5	Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1>	if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2>	treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE:	This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in clause 10.3.
11	Radio information related interactions between network nodes
11.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes. These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e. the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
11.2	Inter-node RRC messages
11.2.1	General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single 'logical channel' is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

HandoverPreparationInformation field descriptions
as-Context
Local RAN context required by the target gNB or DU.
rrm-Config
Local RAN context used mainly for RRM purposes.
sourceConfig
The radio resource configuration as used in the source cell.
ue-CapabilityRAT-List
The UE radio access related capabilities concerning RATs supported by the UE. A gNB that retrieves MRDC related capability containers ensures that the set of included MRDC containers is consistent w.r.t. the feature set related information.
ue-InactiveTime
Duration while UE has not received or transmitted any user data. Thus the timer is still running in case e.g., UE measures the neighbour cells for the HO purpose. Value s1 corresponds to 1 second, s2 corresponds to 2 seconds and so on. Value min1 corresponds to 1 minute, value min1s20 corresponds to 1 minute and 20 seconds, value min1s40 corresponds to 1 minute and 40 seconds and so on. Value hr1 corresponds to 1 hour, hr1min30 corresponds to 1 hour and 30 minutes and so on.

AS-Config field descriptions
rrcReconfiguration
Contains the RRCReconfiguration configuration as generated entirely by the MN. If the TMGI-r17 is included in the MRB-ToAddMod-r17 in the RadioBearerConfig, the plmn-Index is replaced by the PLMN ID, if needed.
sdt-Config
Contains the IE SDT-Config as generated entirely by the last serving gNB. This field is only used during the SDT procedure with UE context relocation as defined in TS 38.300 [2], clause 18.2.
sourceRB-SN-Config
Contains the IE RadioBearerConfig as generated entirely by the SN. This field is only used when the UE is configured with SN terminated RB(s).
sourceSCG-Configured
Value true indicates that the UE is configured with NR or EUTRA SCG in source configuration. The field is only used in NR-DC and NE-DC and is included only if the fields sourceSCG-NR-Config and sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config are absent.
sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config
Contains the current dedicated SCG configuration in RRCConnectionReconfiguration message as specified in TS 36.331 [10] and generated entirely by the SN. In this version of the specification, the E-UTRA RRCConnectionReconfiguration message can only include the field scg-Configuration . This field is only used in NE-DC.
sourceSCG-NR-Config
Contains the current dedicated SCG configuration in RRCReconfiguration message as generated entirely by the SN. In this version of the specification, the RRCReconfiguration message can only include fields secondaryCellGroup and measConfig. This field is only used in NR-DC.

AS-Context field descriptions
configRestrictInfoDAPS
Includes fields for which source cell explicitly indicates the restriction to be observed by target cell during DAPS handover.
mbsInterestIndication
Includes the information last reported by the UE in the NR MBSInterestIndication message, where the plmn-Index (if included by the UE in tmgi) is replaced by the PLMN ID, if needed.
needForGapsInfoNR
Includes measurement gap requirement information of the UE for NR target bands.
selectedBandCombinationSN
Indicates the band combination selected by SN in (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC, and NR-DC.

This field includes SidelinkUEInformation IE as specified in TS 36.331 [10].
sidelinkUEInformationNR
This field includes SidelinkUEInformationNR IE.
ueAssistanceInformation
Includes for each UE assistance feature the information last reported by the UE, if any.
ueAssistanceInformationSCG
Includes for each UE assistance feature associated with the SCG, the information last reported by the UE in the NR UEAssistanceInformation message for the SCG, if any.

ConfigRestrictInfoDAPS field descriptions
sourceFeatureSetPerUplinkCC/sourceFeatureSetPerDownlinkCC
Indicates an index referring to the position of the FeatureSetUplinkPerCC/FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC selected by source in the featureSetsUplinkPerCC/featureSetsDownlinkPerCC.

RRM-Config field descriptions
candidateCellInfoList
A list of the best cells on each frequency for which measurement information was available
candidateCellInfoListSN-EUTRA
A list of EUTRA cells including serving cells and best neighbour cells on each serving frequency, for which measurement results were available. This field is only used in NE-DC.

11.2.3	Mandatory information in inter-node RRC messages
For the AS-Config transferred within the HandoverPreparationInformation:
-	The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current AS configuration of the UE, except for the fields sourceSCG-NR-Config, sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config and sourceRB-SN-Config, which can be omitted in case the source MN did not receive the latest configuration from the source SN. For RRCReconfiguration included in the field rrcReconfiguration, ReconfigurationWithSync is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g. newUE-Identity and t304) and ServingCellConfigCommon;
-	Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined in clause 6 do not apply. I.e. some fields shall be included regardless of the "Need" or "Cond" e.g. discardTimer;
-	Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the delta (difference) to the current AS configuration (as included in HandoverCommand)to the UE. The fields newUE-Identity and t304 included in ReconfigurationWithSync are not used for delta configuration purpose.
The candidateCellInfoListSN(-EUTRA) in CG-Config and the candidateCellInfoListMN(-EUTRA)/candidateCellInfoListSN(-EUTRA) in CG-ConfigInfo need not be included in procedures that do not involve a change of node.
For fields scg-CellGroupConfig, scg-CellGroupConfigEUTRA and scg-RB-Config in CG-Config (sent upon SN initiated SN change or other conditions as specified in field descriptions) and fields mcg-RB-Config, scg-RB-Config and sourceConfigSCG in CG-ConfigInfo (sent upon change of SN):
-	The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current AS configuration of the UE, unless stated otherwise in the field description. For RRCReconfiguration included in the field scg-CellGroupConfig in CG-Config, ReconfigurationWithSync is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g. newUE-Identity and t304) and ServingCellConfigCommon;
-	Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined in clause 6 do not apply;
-	Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the delta (difference) as compared to the current AS configuration to the UE. The fields newUE-Identity and t304 in ReconfigurationWithSync are always included by the target node, i.e. they are not used for delta configuration purpose to UE.
For fields in CG-Config and CG-ConfigInfo listed below, absence of the field means that the receiver maintains the values informed via the previous message. Note that every time there is a change in the configuration covered by a listed field, the MN or SN shall include the field and it shall provide the full configuration provided by that field unless stated otherwise. Otherwise, if there is no change, the field can be omitted:
-	configRestrictInfo;
-	gapPurpose;
-	measGapConfig (for which delta signaling applies);
-	measGapConfigFR2 (for which delta signaling applies);
-	measResultCellListSFTD;

12	Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ms] from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 [14], clause 8.6.3.

Annex A (informative):	Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
A.1	Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
A.2	Procedural specification
A.2.1	General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g. general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
A.2.2	More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
-	Bullets:
-	Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are part of the sentence starting with 'The UE shall:'
-	All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a semi-colon i.e. an ';.
-	Conditions:
-	Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in 'if cond1, or cond2.
A.3	PDU specification
A.3.1	General principles
A.3.1.1	ASN.1 clauses
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [6], X.681 [7].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 clauses in the specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1 code from the specification, each ASN.1 clause begins with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 start tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "ASN1START" (in all upper case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a block start tag is included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-START" (in all upper case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters).
Similarly, each ASN.1 clause ends with the following:
-	a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a blockstop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string "TAG-NAME-STOP" (in all upper-case letters), where the "NAME" refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);
-	a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an ASN.1 stop tag, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text "ASN1STOP" (in all upper case letters).
This results in the following tags:
-- ASN1START
-- TAG-NAME-START

-- TAG-NAME-STOP
-- ASN1STOP

The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should not contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE:	A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
A.3.1.2	ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should be based on the following guidelines:
-	Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without hyphenation. These identifiers, e.g., the RRCConnectionModificationCommand, should be used for reference in the procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
-	Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case, with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a capital, e.g., EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since the "d" in "Selected" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-TimeDifference.
-	Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case thereafter, e.g., establishmentCause. If a field identifier begins with an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is lowercase (plmn-Identity, not pLMN-Identity). The acronym is set off with a hyphen (ue-Identity, not ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers.
-	Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like 'Info') for the name.
-	Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent possible.
-	Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use 'Meas' instead of 'Measurement' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
-	For future extension: When an extension is introduced a suffix is added to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the form "‑rX" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, e.g., Foo-r9 for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type Foo. A suffix of the form "‑rXb" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same release (X) as the original version of the field, "‑rXc" for a second intra-release revision and so on. A suffix of the form "‑vXYZ" is used for ASN.1 fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or type (see clause A.4), e.g., AnElement-v10b0 for the extension of the ASN.1 type AnElement introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number 0...9, 10, 11, etc. is used to represent the first part of the version number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters a, b, c, etc. are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number if they are greater than 9. In the procedural specification, in field descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
-	More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the identifiers e.g. MeasObjectUTRA, ConfigCommon. When there is no particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the different variants.
-	It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid certain compiler errors).

NOTE:	The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
A.3.1.3	Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the referenced type. The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the italic font style. The "do not check spelling and grammar" attribute in Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., "") should not be used around the ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "message", e.g., a reference to the RRCRelease message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field identifier followed by the word "field", e.g., a reference to the prioritisedBitRate field in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            Priority,
        prioritisedBitRate                  PrioritisedBitRate,
        bucketSizeDuration                  BucketSizeDuration,
        logicalChannelGroup                 INTEGER (0..3)
    }       OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

NOTE:	All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 clauses, used as examples in this annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym "IE", e.g., a reference to the IE LogicalChannelConfig in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1 value, e.g., 'if the status field is set to value true'.
A.3.2	High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
    message                 DL-DCCH-MessageType
}

DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
    c1                      CHOICE {
        dlInformationTransfer                   DLInformationTransfer,
        handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest     HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
        mobilityFromEUTRACommand                MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
        rrcConnectionReconfiguration            RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
        rrcConnectionRelease                    RRCConnectionRelease,
        securityModeCommand                     SecurityModeCommand,
        ueCapabilityEnquiry                     UECapabilityEnquiry,
        spare1 NULL
    },
    messageClassExtension   SEQUENCE {}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using the messageClassExtension alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
A.3.3	Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 clause similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::=    SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        c1                                  CHOICE{
            rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8     RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
            spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
        },
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the IEs here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Hooks for critical and non-critical extension should normally be included in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described in clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the inner level c1 CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., spare3 down to spare1 in this case) may be included within the c1 CHOICE. The number of spare alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original specifications are used up, is facilitated using the criticalExtensionsFuture in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases of the protocol, the inner level c1 CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be excluded, as shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
    rrc-TransactionIdentifier           RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
    criticalExtensions                  CHOICE {
        rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
                                            RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
        criticalExtensionsFuture            SEQUENCE {}
    }
}

RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    -- Enter the fields here.
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker "...". The original specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::=                   SEQUENCE {
    field1                                  InformationElement1,
    field2                                  InformationElement2,

    nonCriticalExtension                    SEQUENCE {}                     OPTIONAL
}

-- ASN1STOP

The ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a field description table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g. because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that needs to be specified.
%PDU-TypeIdentifier% field descriptions
%field identifier%
Field description.
%field identifier%
Field description.

The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall include a first paragraph with a field identifier (in bold and italic font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style), e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be omitted from the field description table.
A.3.4	Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 clause similar to the one shown in the example below.
-- /example/ ASN1START

-- ASN1STOP

IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in this example, are preferably placed together in a common ASN.1 clause. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base, defined as the generic type identifier. It may be complemented by a suffix to distinguish the different variants. The "PRACH-Config" is the generic type identifier in this example, and the "SIB" suffix is added to distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of an existing IE is created for critical or non-critical extension of the protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the IE is included in the same ASN.1 clause defining the original. A suffix is added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo in the example above, may be included in the ASN.1 clause and be referenced in the other IE types defined in the same ASN.1 clause. The use of locally defined IE types should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE PRACH-ConfigInfo, should not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 clauses in the RRC specification. An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 clause should be defined in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 clause (possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs PRACH-ConfigSIB and PRACH-Config in the example above). Such IE types are also referred to as 'global IEs'.
NOTE:	Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the context of another ASN.1 clause, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error. Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the example above, may be followed by a field description table, where a further description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the field description table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type.
A.3.5	Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a value for that field in the encoding:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PreambleInfo ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    numberOfRA-Preambles                INTEGER (1..64)                     DEFAULT 1,
    ...
}

-- ASN1STOP

Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PRACH-Config ::=                    SEQUENCE {
    rootSequenceIndex                   INTEGER (0..1023),
    prach-ConfigInfo                    PRACH-ConfigInfo                    OPTIONAL    -- Need N
}

-- ASN1STOP

The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted, should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code includes the keyword "Need", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (S, M, N or R) defined in clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is used, the semantics of the absent field are further specified either in the field description table following the ASN.1 clause, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE, then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
A.3.6	Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword "Cond", followed by a condition tag associated with the field ("UL" in this example):
-- /example/ ASN1START

LogicalChannelConfig ::=            SEQUENCE {
    ul-SpecificParameters               SEQUENCE {
        priority                            INTEGER (0),
        ...
    }       OPTIONAL                                                                    -- Cond UL
}

-- ASN1STOP

When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 clause, the field description table after the ASN.1 clause shall be followed by a conditional presence table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 clause.
Conditional presence
Explanation
UL
Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the condition tag = "UL". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain conditions may also be specified.

The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading: "Conditional presence") contains the condition tag (in italic font style), which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 clause to an entry in the table. The second column (heading: "Explanation") contains a text specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field depends on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same message. If the presence of a field depends on whether another feature/function has been configured, while this function can be configured independently e.g. by another message and/or at another point in time, the relation is best reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 clause does not include any fields with conditional presence, the conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of conditional presence should be considered.
A.3.7	Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in the following example:
-- /example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::=           SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo

PLMN-IdentityInfo ::=               SEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                       PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse          ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code to contain types with unpredictable names:
-- /bad example/ ASN1START

PLMN-IdentityList ::=                   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
    plmn-Identity                           PLMN-Identity,
    cellReservedForOperatorUse              ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}

-- ASN1STOP

A.3.8	Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
The usage of the parameterised SetupRelease type is like a function call in programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX               SetupRelease { IE-rX }                   OPTIONAL,      --  Need M
    ...
}


RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX               SetupRelease { Element-rX }
}                                                                   OPTIONAL,       -- Need M

Element-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
    field1-rX                  IE1-rX,
    field2-rX                  IE2-rX                               OPTIONAL        -- Need N
}                                                                       OPTIONAL,   -- Need M

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

The SetupRelease is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example below is not allowed:
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    field-rX       SetupRelease { SEQUENCE {   -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
            field1-rX                  IE1-rX,
            field2-rX                  IE2-rX                         OPTIONAL        -- Need N
        }
    }                                                                     OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
}

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the type itself, namely, "setup" and "release". For example, procedural text for field-rX above could be as follows:
1> if field-rX is set to "setup":
2> do something;
1> else (field-rX is set to "release"):
2> release field-rX (if appropriate).
A.3.9	Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used. Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1 provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list. In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
-- /example/ ASN1START

AnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementsToAddModList    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    elementsToReleaseList   SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId                                   OPTIONAL,   --  Need N
    ...
}

Element ::=             SEQUENCE {
    elementId               ElementId,
    aField                  INTEG ER (0..16777215),
    anotherField            OCTET STRING,
    ...
}

ElementId ::=           INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)

maxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 49

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER) that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well as in the elementsToReleaseList.
Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as "Need N". The need code reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously signalled elementsToAddModList or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would imply). The update is always in relation to the UE's internal configuration.
Note that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other field) releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by elementsToAddModList and any other sub-field).
If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList, the following generic procedure applies:
The UE shall:
1>	for each ElementId in the elementsToReleaseList,:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	release the Element from the current UE configuration;
1>	for each Element in the elementsToAddModList:
2>	if the current UE configuration includes an Element with the given ElementId:
3>	modify the configured Element in accordance with the received Element;
2>	else:
3>	add received Element to the UE configuration.
A.3.10	Guidelines on use of lists (without ToAddModList and ToReleaseList)
As per clause 6.1.3, when using lists without the ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure, the contents of the lists are always replaced. To illustrate this, an example is provided below:
-- /example/ ASN1START
-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_START

AnExampleIE ::=         SEQUENCE {
    elementList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element                                     OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    ...,
    [[
    elementListExt-v2030    SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElementsExt)) OF Element                                  OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    ]]
}

Element ::=         SEQUENCE {
    useFeatureX         BOOLEAN,
    aField              INTEGER (0..127)                                                                        OPTIONAL,   --  Need M
    anotherField        INTEGER (0..127)                                                                        OPTIONAL,   --  Need R
    ...
}

maxNrofElements         INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElements-1       INTEGER ::= 7
maxNrofElementsExt      INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElementsExt-1    INTEGER ::= 7

-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_STOP
-- /example/ ASN1STOP

As can be seen, the elementList list itself uses Need M, but each list entry Element contains mandatory, Need M and Need R fields. If the list is first signalled to UE with 3 entries, and subsequently again with 2 entries, UE shall retain only the latter list, i.e. the list with 2 elements will completely replace the list with 3 elements. That also means that the field aField will be treated as if it was newly created, i.e. network must include it if it wishes UE to utilize the field even if it was previously signalled. This also implies that the Need M field (aField) will be treated in the same way as the Need R field (anotherField), i.e. delta signalling is not applied and the network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the value (which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these lists).
A.4	Extension of the PDU specifications
A.4.1	General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
-	Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected behaviour or damage).
-	Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of the other parts of the message).
-	Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used, the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when there is a need to introduce a 'clean' message version. Such a need appears when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical extension mechanisms.
A.4.2	Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are both "outer branch" and "inner branch" mechanisms available. The "outer branch" consists of a CHOICE having the name criticalExtensions, with two values, c1 and criticalExtensionsFuture. The criticalExtensionsFuture branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the "inner branch" mechanism.
The "inner branch" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form "MessageName-rX-IEs" (e.g., "RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs") or "spareX", with the spare values having type NULL. The "-rX-IEs" structures contain the complete structure of the message IEs for the appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10 version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an 'outer branch', or an 'outer branch' in combination with an 'inner branch' including a certain number of spares:
-	For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
-	An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
-	The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values). The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
-	In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release

        }
    }
}

-- ASN1STOP

It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release.
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Original release

Conditional presence
Explanation
NoField2rN
The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent. Otherwise the field is absent

Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critical extension.
In the case of list fields (SEQUENCE OF types in ASN.1) using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction, the use of critical extensions to increase the size of a list should be avoided; that is, replacing the original list field by a new field also used to signal entries previously covered by the original field (i.e. extensions done according to the following example) should be avoided:
-- /example/ ASN1START                  -- Discouraged example

Instead, a non-critical list extension mechanism should typically be used, such that the extension field only adds the new entries of the list.  This approach is further described in clause A.4.3.6.
If the critical extension mechanism for a list is used, it should be clarified in the field description that the two versions of the list are not configured together, and that the network should release the contents of the original version when configuring the replacement version.
A.4.3	Non-critical extension of messages
A.4.3.1	General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional guidelines apply:
-	When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
-	The extension marker ("...") is the primary non-critical extension mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length determinant is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
-	at the end of a message;
-	at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
-	When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the 'default extension location').
-	It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible level.
-	In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere (referred to as the 'actual extension location') e.g. when it is possible to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
-	In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher level in the message should be considered.
-	In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE should be defined. The IE's ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same ASN.1 clause as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not always be introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual extension location are within the same ASN.1 clause.
A.4.3.2	Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous clause, the following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
-	Extension markers within SEQUENCE:
-	Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the higher nesting levels.
-	Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).
-	Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT.
-	Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully.
-	The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the specification are grouped together using double brackets.
-	Extension markers within ENUMERATED:
-	Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next power of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit, given that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible without any error cases.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new value, e.g. "value-vXYZ".
-	Extension markers within CHOICE:
-	Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g. ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the extended value.
-	A suffix of the form "vXYZ" is used for the identifier of each new choice value, e.g. "choice-vXYZ".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an OCTET or BIT STRING:
-	When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a "Need" code should not be provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a "Need" code when the field is not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
-	In case a need code is not provided for a group, a "Need" code is provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the action upon absence of the whole group.
A.4.3.3	Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism is used.
NOTE	In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions of InformationElement1 as shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement1 is initially extended with a number of non-critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE InformationElement1 (i.e. InformationElement1-r10) is defined in which the earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the original field.
–	The value4-v880 is replacing a spare value defined in the original protocol version for field1. Likewise value6-v1170 replaces spare3 that was originally defined in the r10 version of field1.
–	Within the critically extended release 10 version of InformationElement1, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the field1 and InformationElement4 were defined in the original protocol version (release 8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the field3-r9 is introduced in release 9 and not re-tagged; although, the InformationElement3 is also critically extended and therefore tagged InformationElement3-r10 in the release 10 version of InformationElement1.
A.4.3.4	Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The InformationElement4 is introduced in the original version of the protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
A.4.3.5	Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
–	ParentIE-WithEM
The IE ParentIE-WithEMis an example of a high level IE including the extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM and ChildIE2-WithoutEM which not include the extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 and ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 (both in release N) are used to connect non-critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs to the actual extension location in this IE.

    ]]
}

-- ASN1STOP

Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
–	The fields childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0 may not really need to be optional (depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
–	In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
–	ChildIE1-WithoutEM
The IE ChildIE1-WithoutEM is an example of a lower level IE, used to control certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be setup or released using the local IE ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature. The example illustrates how the new field chIE1-NewField is added in release N to the configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the following assumptions:
–	When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
–	When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be released also.
–	When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
–	When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

A.4.3.6	Non-critical extensions of lists with ToAddMod/ToRelease
When the size of a list using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction is extended and/or fields are added to the list element structure, the list should be non-critically extended in accordance with the following general principles:
–	When only the size of the list is extended, this extension is reflected in a non-critical extension of the list, with a "SizeExt" suffix added to the end of the field name (before the -vNxy suffix). The differential size of the extended list uses the suffix "Diff". A new ToRelease list is needed, and its range should include only the increase in list size. In many cases, extending the list size will also require an extended list element ID type to account for the increased size of the list; in these cases the element type will need to be extended to include the extended element ID, resulting in a more complex extension (see example 3 for further discussion of this case). The field description table should indicate that the UE considers the original list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the following example:

-- /example 1/ ASN1START

ContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {
    listElementToAddModList              SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElement             OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    listElementToReleaseList             SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF ListElementId           OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    ...,
    [[
    -- Non-critical extension lists
    listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy  SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement      OPTIONAL,    -- Need N
    listElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId    OPTIONAL     -- Need N
    ]]
}
-- ASN1STOP

–	When fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix "Ext" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name (before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the new structures, also with the "Ext" suffix. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should typically be ensured that the contained fields in the "Ext" elements are releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish the lists (e.g. listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz added after listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy). The result is as shown in the following example:
-- /example 2/ ASN1START

ContainingStructure ::=             SEQUENCE {

–	When the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as described in example 1 above. Note that if the list element ID type changes in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID (e.g. ListElementId-vNxy). If no extension marker is available or if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the extension list holding new entries. The field description table should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel ToRelease list is needed (i.e. there is no listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:

–	When different extensions are made to a list in separate releases, the extension mechanisms described above may interact. In case fields are added in Rel-M (listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy) and later the list size is extended in Rel-N (listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz), the size-extended list in Rel-N should be a single list extending the combination of listElementToAddModList and listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy. This requires creating a new type (ListElement-rN) to contain the combined fields of ListElement and ListElementExt-vMxy. A corresponding ToRelease list is needed. The result is as shown in the following example:
-- /example 4/ ASN1START

A.5	Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a Transaction identifier
1:	DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC transaction identifier.
2:	All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC transaction identifier.
3:	All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4:	All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an RRC transaction identifier.
5:	All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction identifier.
A.6	Guidelines regarding use of need codes
The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional downlink fields:
- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
- use Need M (=Maintain);
- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
- use Need R (=Release);
- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
- use Need N (=None);
- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
- use Need S (=Specified);
- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text or in the field description table.
A.7	Guidelines regarding use of conditions
Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the following types can be distinguished:
-	Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.
-	Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled if field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether field C is present in the same message or previously configured).
The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.
-- /example/ ASN1START

RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
    fieldA                          FieldA                  OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
    fieldB                          FieldB                  OPTIONAL,   -- Cond FieldAsetToX
    fieldC                          FieldC                  OPTIONAL,   -- Need M
    fieldD                          FieldD                  OPTIONAL,   -- Cond FieldCsetToY
    nonCriticalExtension            SEQUENCE {}             OPTIONAL
}

-- /example/ ASN1STOP

Conditional presence
Explanation
FieldAsetToX
The field is mandatory present if fieldA is included and set to valueX. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need R.
FieldCsetToY
The field is optionally present, need M, if fieldC is configured and set to valueY. Otherwise the field is absent and the UE does not maintain the value

A.8	Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous convention should be used:
-	UE capabilities: TS 38.306 [26] specifies that the network should in general respect the UE's capabilities. Hence there is no need to include statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of a certain configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.
Annex B (informative):	RRC Information
B.1	Protection of RRC messages
The following list provides information which messages can be sent (unprotected) prior to AS security activation and which messages can be sent unprotected after AS security activation. Those messages indicated "-" in "P" column should never be sent unprotected by gNB or UE. Further requirements are defined in the procedural text.
P…Messages that can be sent (unprotected) prior to AS security activation
A – I…Messages that can be sent without integrity protection after AS security activation
A – C…Messages that can be sent unciphered after AS security activation
NA… Message can never be sent after AS security activation

B.2	Description of BWP configuration options
There are two possible ways to configure BWP#0 (i.e. the initial BWP) for a UE:
1)	Configure BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon, but do not configure dedicated configurations in BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
2)	Configure both BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon and configure dedicated configurations in at least one of BWP-DownlinkDedicated or BWP-UplinkDedicated in ServingCellConfig.
The same way of configuration is used for UL BWP#0 and DL BWP#0 if both are configured.
With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e., UE only supporting one BWP can still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0 can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn't support DCI-based switching.

Figure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration
With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration. However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0 e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the BWP#0 (compared to the first option).

Figure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration
For BWP#0, the BWP-DownlinkCommon and BWP-UplinkCommon in ServingCellConfigCommon should match the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
If a RedCap-specific initial UL/DL BWP is configured, for BWP switching, the BWP #0 always maps to the RedCap-specific initial UL/DL BWP.

Annex D (normative):	UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax support, i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease shall comprehend the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field accessStratumRelease supports a feature specified in release Y, which is later than release X, (i.e. early UE implementation) additional requirements apply. The UE obviously also has to support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE capabilities).
Critical extensions (dedicated signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions in dedicated signalling, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early. This, in particular, concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the feature.
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release Y involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented feature(s), the UE needs, however, not to support functionality beyond what is defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let's consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field accessStratumRelease that supports the features A1, A3, and A5, associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 of InformationElementA (see ASN.1 below).
The feature A5 implemented early is associated with fieldA5, and can only be configured by the –rY version of InformationElementA. In such case, the UE should support configuration of all the features A1, A3 and A5 associated with fields fieldA1, fieldA3 and fieldA5 by the –rY version of InformationElementA.
If, however, one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature A3 associated with fieldA3, the network should assume the UE only supports the feature A3 according to the release it indicated in field accessStratumRelease (i.e. X).
The UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (n80-vY0) nor the additional sub-field (fieldA3c-rY).
InformationElementA-rX ::=      SEQUENCE {
	fieldA1-rX                      InformationElementA1-rX                 OPTIONAL,   -- Need N

    fieldA5-rY                      InformationElementA5-rY                 OPTIONAL    -- Need R
}

    fieldA3b-rX                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40}              OPTIONAL    -- Need R

    fieldA3a-rY                     InformationElementA3a-rX                OPTIONAL,   -- Need N
    fieldA3b-rY                     ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40, n80-vY0}     OPTIONAL,   -- Need R
    fieldA3c-rY                     InformationElementA3c-rY                OPTIONAL    -- Need R
}

Non-critical extensions (dedicated and broadcast signaling)
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in dedicated signaling, the network does not include extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE indicates early support of in UE capabilities. The UE shall anyway comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) which indicate absence of such extensions.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions in system information, the SIB(s) containing the release Y fields related to the early implemented features may also include other extensions introduced after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE supports. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).
