4	General
4.1	Procedure specification principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional behaviour of the terminating NG-RAN node exactly and completely. Any rule that specifies the behaviour of the originating NG-RAN node shall be possible to be verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure text in clause 8:
-	The procedure text discriminates between:
1)	Functionality which "shall" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the initiating message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause value.
2)	Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
	The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported," perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting node about the not supported functionality.
-	Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is explicitly indicated in the procedure text.

8.2	Basic mobility procedures
8.2.1	Handover Preparation
8.2.1.1	General
This procedure is used to establish necessary resources in an NG-RAN node for an incoming handover. If the procedure concerns a conditional handover, parallel transactions are allowed. Possible parallel requests are identified by the target cell ID when the source UE AP IDs are the same.
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
8.2.1.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.2.1.2-1: Handover Preparation, successful operation
The source NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message to the target NG-RAN node. When the source NG-RAN node sends the HANDOVER REQUEST message, it shall start the timer TXnRELOCprep.
If the Conditional Handover Information Request IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall consider that the request concerns a conditional handover and shall include the Conditional Handover Information Acknowledge IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE is contained in the Conditional Handover Information Request IE included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, then the target NG-RAN node shall remove the existing prepared conditional HO identified by the Target NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE and the Target Cell Global ID IE. It is up to the implementation of the target NG-RAN node when to remove the HO information.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the source NG-RAN node shall stop the timer TXnRELOCprep and terminate the Handover Preparation procedure. If the procedure was initiated for an immediate handover, the source NG-RAN node shall start the timer TXnRELOCoverall. The source NG-RAN node is then defined to have a Prepared Handover for that Xn UE-associated signalling.
For each E-RAB ID IE included in the QoS Flow To Be Setup List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the content of the IE in the UE context and use it for subsequent inter-system handover.
If the Masked IMEISV IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to determine the characteristics of the UE for subsequent handling.
At reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message the target NG-RAN node shall prepare the configuration of the AS security relation between the UE and the target NG-RAN node by using the information in the UE Security Capabilities IE and the AS Security Information IE in the UE Context Information IE, as specified in TS 33.501 [28].
Upon reception of the PDU Session Resource Setup List IE, contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall behave the same as specified in TS 38.413 [5] for the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure. The target NG-RAN node shall report in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the successful establishment of the result for all the requested PDU session resources. When the target NG-RAN node reports the unsuccessful establishment of a PDU session resource, the cause value should be precise enough to enable the source NG-RAN node to know the reason for the unsuccessful establishment.
For each PDU session if the PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE is included in the PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List IE contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall store the received PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context and use it when enforcing traffic policing for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
For each QoS flow for which the source NG-RAN node proposes to perform forwarding of downlink data, the source NG-RAN node shall include the DL Forwarding IE set to "DL forwarding proposed" within the Data Forwarding and Offloading Info from source NG-RAN node IE in the PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message. The source NG-RAN node shall include the DL Forwarding IE set to "DL forwarding proposed" for all the QoS flows mapped to a DRB, if it requests a DAPS handover for that DRB. 
For each PDU session for which the target NG-RAN node decides to admit the data forwarding for at least one QoS flow, the target NG-RAN node may include the PDU Session level DL data forwarding UP TNL Information IE within the Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node IE in the PDU Session Resource Admitted Info IE contained in the PDU Session Resources Admitted List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
For each QoS flow for which the source NG-RAN node has not yet received the SDAP end marker packet if QoS flow re-mapping happened before handover, the source NG-RAN node shall include the UL Forwarding Proposal IE within the Data Forwarding and Offloading Info from source NG-RAN node IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, and if the target NG-RAN node decides to admit uplink data forwarding for at least one QoS flow, the target NG-RAN node may include the PDU Session Level UL Data Forwarding UP TNL Information IE in the Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node IE in the PDU Session Resources Admitted Item IE contained in the PDU Session Resources Admitted List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to indicate that it accepts the uplink data forwarding.
For each PDU session resource successfully setup at the target NG-RAN, the target NG-RAN node may allocate resources for additional Xn-U PDU session resource GTP-U tunnels, indicated in the Secondary Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node List IE.
For each PDU session in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, if the Alternative QoS Parameters Set List IE is included in the GBR QoS Flow Information IE in the PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List IE, the target NG-RAN node may accept the setup of the involved QoS flow when notification control has been enabled if the requested QoS parameters set or at least one of the alternative QoS parameters sets can be fulfilled at the time of handover as specified in TS 23.501 [7]. In case the target NG-RAN node accepts the handover fulfilling one of the alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate the alternative QoS parameters set which it can currently fulfil in the Current QoS Parameters Set Index IE within the PDU Session Resources Admitted List IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message while setting the QoS parameters towards the UE according to the requested QoS parameters set as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
For each DRB for which the source NG-RAN node proposes to perform forwarding of downlink data, the source NG-RAN node shall include the DRB ID IE and the mapped QoS Flows List IE within the Source DRB to QoS Flow Mapping List IE contained in the PDU Session Resources To Be Setup List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST message. The source NG-RAN node may include the QoS Flow Mapping Indication IE in the Source DRB to QoS Flow Mapping List IE to indicate that only the uplink or downlink QoS flow is mapped to the DRB. If the target NG-RAN node decides to use the same DRB configuration and to map the same QoS flows as the source NG-RAN node, the target NG-RAN node includes the DL Forwarding GTP Tunnel Endpoint IE within the Data Forwarding Response DRB List IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message to indicate that it accepts the proposed forwarding of downlink data for this DRB.
The target NG-RAN node may additionally include the Redundant DL Forwarding UP TNL Information IE if at least one of the QoS flow mapped to the DRB is eligible to the redundant transmission feature as indicated in the Redundant QoS Flow Indicator IE within the PDU Session Resource To Be Setup List IE received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message for the QoS flow.
If the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message contains the UL Forwarding UP TNL Information IE for a given DRB in the Data Forwarding Response DRB List IE within Data Forwarding Info from target NG-RAN node IE in the PDU Session Resources Admitted List IE and the source NG-RAN node accepts the data forwarding proposed by the target NG-RAN node, the source NG-RAN node shall perform forwarding of uplink data for the DRB.
If the HANDOVER REQUEST includes PDU session resources for PDU sessions associated to S-NSSAIs not supported by target NG-RAN, the target NG-RAN node shall reject such PDU session resources. In this case, and if at least one PDU Session Resource To Be Setup Item IE is admitted, the target NG-RAN node shall send the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message including the PDU Session Resources Not Admitted List IE listing corresponding PDU sessions rejected at the target NG-RAN.
If the Mobility Restriction List IE is

8.2.2	SN Status Transfer
8.2.2.1	General
The purpose of the SN Status Transfer procedure is to transfer the uplink PDCP SN and HFN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status either, from the source to the target NG-RAN node during an Xn handover, between the NG-RAN nodes involved in dual connectivity, or after retrieval of a UE context for RRC reestablishment, for each respective DRB of the source DRB configuration for which PDCP SN and HFN status preservation applies.
In case that the Xn handover is a DAPS handover, the SN Status Transfer procedure may also be used to transfer the uplink PDCP SN and HFN receiver status, and the downlink PDCP SN and HFN transmitter status for a DRB associated with RLC-UM and configured with DAPS as described in TS 38.300 [9].
In case that the Xn handover is a CHO, the SN Status Transfer procedure may also be used to transfer handover related information.
If the SN Status Transfer procedure is applied in the course of dual connectivity or RRC connection re-establishment in the subsequent specification text
-	the behaviour of the NG-RAN node from which the DRB context is transferred, i.e. the NG-RAN node involved in dual connectivity or RRC connection re-establishment, from which data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of the "source NG-RAN node",
-	the behaviour of the NG-RAN node to which the DRB context is transferred, i.e., the NG-RAN node involved in dual connectivity or RRC connection re-establishment, to which data is forwarded, is specified by the behaviour of the "target NG-RAN node".
The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.

8.4.1	Xn Setup
8.4.1.1	General
The purpose of the Xn Setup procedure is to exchange application level configuration data needed for two NG-RAN nodes to interoperate correctly over the Xn-C interface. 
NOTE 1:	If Xn-C signalling transport is shared among multiple Xn-C interface instances, one Xn Setup procedure is issued per Xn-C interface instance to be setup, i.e. several Xn Setup procedures may be issued via the same TNL association after that TNL association has become operational. 
NOTE 2:	Exchange of application level configuration data also applies between two NG-RAN nodes in case the SN (i.e. the gNB) does not broadcast system information other than for radio frame timing and SFN, as specified in the TS 37.340 [8]. How to use this information when this option is used is not explicitly specified.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.

If the initiating node does not receive the RESET RESPONSE message, the initiating node may reinitiate the Reset procedure towards the same NG-RAN node, provided that the content of the new RESET REQUEST message is identical to the content of the previously unacknowledged RESET REQUEST message.
8.4.5	Error Indication
8.4.5.1	General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an NG-RAN node to report detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.4.5.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.5.2-1: Error Indication, successful operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication procedure is initiated by the ERROR INDICATION message sent from the node detecting the error situation.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the Cause IE or the Criticality Diagnostics IE.
In case the Error Indication procedure is triggered by UE associated signalling, in the course of handover signalling and signalling for dual connectivity, the Old NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE and the New NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If any of the Old NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE and the New NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID IE is not correct, the cause shall be set to an appropriate value.

8.4.6	Xn Removal
8.4.6.1	General
The purpose of the Xn Removal procedure is to remove the interface instance between two NG-RAN nodes in a controlled manner. If successful, this procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the two nodes.
NOTE:	In case the signalling transport is shared among several Xn-C interface instances, and the TNL association is still used by one or more Xn-C interface instances, the initiating NG-RAN node should not initiate the removal of the TNL association.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signaling.
8.4.6.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.6.2-1: Xn Removal, successful operation
An NG-RAN node1 initiates the procedure by sending the XN REMOVAL REQUEST message to a candidate NG-RAN node2. Upon reception of the XN REMOVAL REQUEST message the candidate NG-RAN node2 shall reply with the XN REMOVAL RESPONSE message. After receiving the XN REMOVAL RESPONSE message, the initiating NG-RAN node1 shall initiate removal of the TNL association towards NG-RAN node2 and may remove all resources associated with that interface instance. The candidate NG-RAN node2 may then remove all resources associated with that interface instance.
If the Xn Removal Threshold IE is included in the XN REMOVAL REQUEST message, the candidate NG-RAN node2 shall, if supported, accept to remove the interface instance with NG-RAN node1 if the Xn Benefit Value of the interface instance determined at the candidate NG-RAN node2 is lower than the value of the Xn Removal Threshold IE.

8.4.7	Failure Indication
8.4.7.1	General
The purpose of the Failure Indication procedure is to transfer information regarding RRC re-establishment attempts, or received RLF Reports, between NG-RAN nodes. The signalling takes place from the NG-RAN node at which a re-establishment attempt is made, or an RLF Report is received, to an NG-RAN node to which the UE concerned may have previously been attached prior to the connection failure. This may aid the detection of radio link failure, handover failure cases.
The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.4.7.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.7.2-1: Failure Indication, successful operation
NG-RAN node2 initiates the procedure by sending the FAILURE INDICATION message to NG-RAN node1, following a re-establishment attempt or an RLF Report reception from a UE at NG-RAN node2, when NG-RAN node2 considers that the UE may have previously suffered a connection failure at a cell controlled by NG-RAN node1.

The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
8.4.8.2	Successful Operation

Figure 8.4.8.2-1: Handover Report, successful operation
NG-RAN node1 initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REPORT message to NG-RAN node2. When receiving the message NG-RAN node2 shall assume that a mobility-related problem was detected.
If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "HO too early" or "HO to wrong cell", then NG-RAN node1 indicates to NG-RAN node2 that, following a successful handover from a cell of NG-RAN node2 to a cell of NG-RAN node1, a radio link failure occurred and the UE attempted RRC Re-establishment or re-connected either at the original cell of NG-RAN node2 (Handover Too Early), or at another cell (Handover to Wrong Cell). The detection of Handover Too Early and Handover to Wrong Cell events is made according to TS 38.300 [9].
The HANDOVER REPORT message may include:
-	the Mobility Information IE, if the Mobility Information IE was sent for this handover from NG-RAN node2 (in case the NG-RAN node2 provided it more than once, the most recent Mobility Information IE is included in the HANDOVER REPORT message);
-	the Source cell C-RNTI IE.
-	the CHO Configuration IE, if the CHO Configuration IE was sent for this handover from NG-RAN node2.
If received, NG-RAN node2 uses the above information according to TS 38.300 [9].
If the Handover Report Type IE is set to "Inter-system ping-pong", then NG-RAN node2 shall deduce that a completed handover from a cell of NG-RAN node2 to a cell in another system might have resulted in an inter-system ping-pong and the UE was successfully handed over to a cell of NG-RAN node1 (indicated with Target cell CGI IE).
Interaction with the Failure Indication procedure:
If NG-RAN node1 receives a UE RLF Report from an NG-RAN node via the FAILURE INDICATION message, as described in TS 38.300 [9], NG-RAN node1 may also include it in the UE RLF Report Container IE included in the HANDOVER REPORT message.

9.2	Information Element definitions
9.2.0	General
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by bit strings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of bits:
-	The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
-	The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
-	When importing bit strings from other specifications, the first bit of the bit string contains the first bit of the concerned information.

The meaning of the different cause values is specified in the following table. In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to perform the requested action.
Radio Network Layer cause
Meaning
Cell not Available
The concerned cell is not available.
Handover Desirable for Radio Reasons
The reason for requesting handover is radio related.
Handover Target not Allowed
Handover to the indicated target cell is not allowed for the UE in question.
Invalid AMF Set ID
The target NG-RAN node doesn’t belong to the same AMF Set of the source NG-RAN node, i.e. NG handovers should be attempted instead.
No Radio Resources Available in Target Cell
The target cell doesn’t have sufficient radio resources available.
Partial Handover
Provides a reason for the handover cancellation. The target NG-RAN node did not admit all PDU Sessions included in the HANDOVER REQUEST and the source NG-RAN node estimated service continuity for the UE would be better by not proceeding with handover towards this particular target NG-RAN node.
Reduce Load in Serving Cell
Load in serving cell needs to be reduced. When applied to handover preparation, it indicates the handover is triggered due to load balancing.
Resource Optimisation Handover
The reason for requesting handover is to improve the load distribution with the neighbour cells.
Value out of allowed range
The action failed because the proposed Handover Trigger parameter change in the NG-RAN node2 Proposed Mobility Parameters IE is too low or too high.
Time Critical Handover
Handover is requested for time critical reason i.e. this cause value is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is likely to be dropped if handover is not performed.
TXnRELOCoverall Expiry
The reason for the action is expiry of timer TXnRELOCoverall.
TXnRELOCprep Expiry
Handover Preparation procedure is cancelled when timer TXnRELOCprep expires.
Unknown GUAMI ID
The target NG-RAN node belongs to the same AMF Set of the source NG-RAN node and recognizes the AMF Set ID. However, the GUAMI value is unknown to the target NG-RAN node.
Unknown Local NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID 
The action failed because the receiving NG-RAN node does not recognise the local NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID.
Inconsistent Remote NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID
The action failed because the receiving NG-RAN node considers that the received remote NG-RAN node UE XnAP ID is inconsistent..
Encryption And/Or Integrity Protection Algorithms Not Supported
The target NG-RAN node is unable to support any of the encryption and/or integrity protection algorithms supported by the UE.
Multiple PDU Session ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same PDU Session had been provided to the NG-RAN node.
Unknown PDU Session ID
The action failed because the PDU Session ID is unknown in the NG-RAN node.
Unknown QoS Flow ID
The action failed because the QoS Flow ID is unknown in the NG-RAN node.
Multiple QoS Flow ID Instances
The action failed because multiple instances of the same QoS flow had been provided to the NG-RAN node.

9.3	Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
9.3.1	General
XnAP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.680 [16] and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [17].
Sub clause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of the XnAP protocol with ASN.1. In case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this sub clause and the tabular format in sub clause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional elements, in which the tabular format shall take precedence.
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of XnAP messages. XnAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall construct an XnAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the following additional rules:
-	IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in object set definitions.
-	Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value "mandatory". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an object has value "optional" or "conditional". If in a tabular format there is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e. an IE list) then in the corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two parts. The first part defines an IE container list in which the list elements reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE:	In the above, "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different occurrences have different IE IDs.
If an XnAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in clause 10.
9.3.2	Usage of Private Message Mechanism for Non-standard Use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
-	for special operator (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to be part of the basic functionality, i.e. the functionality required for a complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor inter-operability.
-	by vendors for research purposes, e.g. to implement and evaluate new algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such functionality shall be standardised.
